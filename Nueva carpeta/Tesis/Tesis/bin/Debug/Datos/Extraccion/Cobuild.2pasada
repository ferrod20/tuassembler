anything
else
,
let
me

latest

the
pop
world

But
before	IN
laughing
and
jeering
too
much
,
one
ought
to
weigh
up
the
issues
raised
by
this
statement
.

He
stood
before	IN
the
panelled
door
leading

In
Liverpool
he
was
befriended	VBN
by
a
passing
student
.

They
never
thought
that
senility
could
ever
befuddle	VB
their
senses
.

Before
long
,
repetition
begets	VBZ
boredom

The
Polish
food
shortage
begot	VBD
significant
political
change

He

The
actors
began	VBD
to
rehearse
a
few
scenes
...

I
was
beginning	VBG
to
feel
better
...

We
began	VBD
chattering
and
laughing
together
.

The
concerts
begin	VBP

8
pm

My
career
as
a
journalist
was
about
to
begin	VB
...

Mr
Carter
was
about
to
begin	VB
his
term
as
President
.

He
began	VBD
by
saying
that
he
would
make
the
province
ungovernable
...

This
is
intolerable
,
began	VBD
Haze
...

I
dont
know
how
to
begin	VB
.

The
newspaper
had
begun	VBN
as
a
duplicated
broadsheet
...

These
clubs
began	VBD
as
coffee-houses
in
the
seventeenth
century
.

She
began	VBD
as
an
actress
...

He
began	VBD
his
Civil
Service
career
as
a
boy
clerk
at
twelve
shillings

week
.

There
is
no
one
place
where
the
Central
Plains
end
and
the
Great
Plains
begin	VBP
...

Still
farther
out
the
true
ocean
depths
begin	VBP
.

This
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
beginners	NNS
write
...

The
ski
run
had
been
closed
to
beginners	NNS
...

...
not
bad
for
a
beginner	NN
.

This
is
just
the
beginning	NN
...

That
was
quite
a
promising
beginning	NN
...

The
wars
end
was
as
dramatic
and
sudden
as
its
beginning	NN
...

The
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
century
beginnings	NNS
of
British
Art

I
came
back

beginning	NN
of

The

increased

thirty-eight

I
do
not
begrudge	VB
her
that
happiness

He
used
his
newspapers
to
beguile	VB
the
readers
into
buying
shares
in
his
company
.

The
voice
was
low
but
beguiling	JJ
.

She
wanted
to
tell
him
why
she
was
behaving	VBG
this
way
...

He
was
very
foolish
to
behave	VB
like
that
...

She
was
still
angry
with
herself
for
behaving	VBG
badly
in
the
hospital
.

Behave	VB
yourself
!
said
Mrs
Jane
...

The
others
prefer
to
persuade
him
to
behave	VB
rather
than
complain
to
the
teacher
...

Hes
old
enough
to
behave	VB
himself
.

...
the
way

behaves	VBZ
at
the
very
lowest
temperatures
...

...
a
circuit
which
behaves	VBZ
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
a
transistor
.

As
always
with
human
behaviour	NN
,
there
are
exceptions
to
this
general
rule
...

...
patterns
of
behaviour	NN
...

...
a
doctor
who
has
studied
the
behaviour	NN
of
hundreds
of
babies
.

The
laws
that
govern
the
behaviour	NN
of

are
universal

Fleming
noted
the
behaviour	NN
of
penicillin
on
human
infections
.

It
was
done
at
the
behest	NN

Queen
Victoria

There
were
two
boys
sitting
behind	RB
me
on
the
bus
...

Behind	RB
Chloe
is
a
large
mirror
...

A
sound
behind	RB
him
made
him
turn
...

Her
neck
also
was
uncommonly
fine
when
seen
from
behind	RB
.

I
hate
being
behind	RB
middle-aged
drivers
...

He
walked
back
to
the
village
behind	RB
his
brother
.

...
the
strain
of
seeing
her
daughter
locked
behind	IN
bars
...

...
racks
of
shotguns
and
hunting
rifles
locked
in
behind	IN

Sales

were
most
brisk
behind	IN
the
Iron
Curtain

...
large

comfortable

Now

Selfridges
...

...
an
extension
of
the
main
shopping
area
,
behind	IN
Lord
Street
.

Precisely
such
irresponsibility
lay
behind	IN
the
citys
school
crises
...

These
were
the
unspoken
reasons
behind	IN
Macleods
statement
that
legislation
was
necessary
.

The
man
behind	IN
the
modernizing
of
the
station
was
Mr
Brown
...

There
must
have
been
a
master
mind
behind	IN
it
all
.

The
country
was
behind	IN
the
President
.

I
just
got
slowly
more
and
more
behind	RB
...

Im
half
an
hour
behind	RB
already
...

The
defence
programme
had
been
allowed
to
fall
behind	RB
.

Both
Watson
and
Trevino
lag
well
behind	IN
Nicklaus
in
major
championship
victories
.

We
must
leave
adolescence
behind	RB
and
grow
up
...

The
fantasies
of
the
night
were
safely
behind	RB
her
.

He
will
linger
behind	RB
occasionally
to
chat
...

Afterwards
Vorster
asked
me
to
stay
behind	RB
.

Millie
had
left
her
cloak
behind	RB

He
slapped
her
on
her
behind	NN
with
his
racket
.

Im
a
bit
behindhand	RB
with
my
work
.

Indeed
,
she
was
a
terrible
sight
to
behold	VB
...

His
eyes
had
never
beheld	VBN
such
opulence

The

In
every

this

a
practical
and
rational
being	VBG

a
human

Marie

about

His

Their

the
popular
image

swashbuckling
rock

The
promises
in
this
manifesto
were
belied	VBD
as
rapidly
as
his
other
promises
.

They

support

Do
you

Are

Most

No

None

This
gave
the

a
feeling

superiority

The

We
went

the

used

The

the
help
thats
given

My
eyes
were
momentarily
blinded	VBN
by
flash
bulbs

The
dust
from
the
roads
in
the
summertime
was
enough
to
blind	VB

She
had
trodden
on
the
broken
bottle

blind	JJ
as
she
was

tears

rage

She
slammed
the
window
down

pulled
the
blind	NN
.

I
realized
how
blind	JJ
the
series
had
made
me
.

We
have
to
beware
that
missionary
zeal
doesnt
blind	VB
us
to
the
realities
here
.

The
girls
were
completely
blind	JJ

the
consequences

their
actions

They
were
not
blind	JJ

the
defects

Western
society

The
outward
part

this
first
mission

been
flown

shuttered

evening

proves

with
all

boarded
up

Renshaw
probably
saw
through

listened
calmly
to

all
.

Editing
a
newspaper
in

country
was
like
walking
blindfold	RB

minefield

I
guarantee
I
could
read

script
blindfold	RB

were
shooting
blindly	RB

the
flames

His
arm
was
on
fire
and
he
ran
blindly	RB
across
the
clearing
,
screaming
.

With
the
information
we
have
now
,
we
can
only
speculate
blindly	RB
...

Of
course
it
is
wrong
for
young
people
to
accept
blindly	RB
existing
standards
.

It
was
his
guilty
blink	NN
that
always
gave
us
away
.

Dots
and
dashes
blinked	VBD
out

There
was
a
blink	NN

bright
light
beyond

forest

...
this
sense
of
having
blinkers	NN
put
on
you
.

After
those
blissful	JJ
two
years
,
I
began
to
hate

They
sat
there
together

blissful	JJ

At

As

Her

Some

wished

broaden	VB
the

For

it

It
would
do
me
good

The

He
made
another

He

The
broadside	NN

He
could

The

was
so
exciting

Philip

It
is
exciting
to
contemplate	VB
how
many
new

are
lying
dormant

He
sat

Are

He
had
never

It
is

She
lay

I
was

They

Her
contempt	NN

obvious

I
shall
treat
that
remark
with
the
contempt	NN
it
deserves

his
contempt	NN
for

You
are
showing

lack

His
lack

had
made
him

I
had

There
were
also

Three

Who

A
few
were
content	JJ

It
seems
that
he
would
have
been
content	JJ

continue

a
long

She
is
not

these
explanations

However
hard
up
they
were

She
hadnt
said
much

had
contented	VBD|VBN

I
contented	VBD|VBN

him

Perhaps
Im

Her
mouth

fixed

pure

My
father
was
the
most
contented	JJ
man

ever
met

They
smoked
for
a
while

contented	JJ

at

.

It
is
my
contention	NN
that
demand
will
exceed
supply
within
the
next
five
years

My
main
contention	NN
is
that
the

would
be
too
expensive
.

He
is
well
known
for
his
contentious	JJ
views

You
appear

There

We
would
hotly
contest	VB
this
idea

I
am
going

contest	VB
the
will
.

They
may
both
be
future
contestants	NNS

We
need
to
place
present

some
kind

We
must
examine
these

He
always
provides
a
context	NN

The

There
was
still
one
British

.

The
raid
was
contingent	JJ
on
the

The
role
they
play
is
contingent	JJ
on
their
political
ability

zeal
.

It
was
sad
to
see
her
the
victim

continual	JJ
pain

Life
is
a
continual	JJ
struggle

warnings

We
saw
the
trip
as
a
natural
continuation	NN

This
idea
is
really
a
continuation	NN

earlier
one

I
continued	VBD

He
continued	VBD
talking

If
the

inevitable
...

They
want

continue	VB
their

We
crossed

She
left
the
village

continued	VBD
on
her
way

The
road
continues	VBZ

Time
does
not
appear

him
as
a
continuous	JJ
,
uninterrupted
process

...
the
steady

continuous	JJ
increase

He
has

contorted	VBD|VBN

it
refused

Their

She
contradicts	VBZ

There

a
mass

contradicts	VBZ
this

All

I
cannot
help
contrasting	VBG
her

His

contrasted	VBD
curiously

the
earthiness

These
first
two
types

Advanced

For

The

The

I
counselled	VBD

You

What

In
sport
what
really
counts	VBZ
is
not

winning

the
playing

When
they
see
somebody

counts	VBZ

they
try
to
make
a
favourable
impression

...
the
doctrine
that
all
individuals
count	VB
.

I
felt
that
all
my
years
there
counted	VBN
for
nothing
...

We
all
want
to
count	VB
for

These

do
not
count	VB

I
get

during
the
term
;
if
I
count	VBP
the

I
get
six

The
use
of
these
tests
is
criticized
on
two
counts	NNS
...

They
are
right
on
the
first
count	NN
but
wrong
on
the
second
.

He
pleaded
guilty

He
is
unlikely

countenance	VB

There
was
a

medicine
counter	NN
.

I
countered	VBD
by
enquiring
whether
she
actually
knew
this
man
...

Mr
Wedgwood
Benn
countered	VBD
with
a
speech
defining
socialist
policies
.

He
argued
that
Labour
should
counter	VB
this
propaganda
with
a
series
of
press
statements
...

To
counter	VB
this
the
police
will
equip
themselves
with
riot
shields
and
tear
gas
.

We
added
malt
flavouring
to
counteract	VB
the
bitterness

the
taste
...

No
amount
of
freedom
at

can
completely
counteract	VB
the
influence

a
bad
home

We
hadnt
expected

to
counter-attack	VB
so
soon

caused
by
a
lack

sufficient
salt
in

diet
to
counterbalance	VB
the
amount
of
salt
lost
in
sweat
...

Thus
political
power
counterbalances	VBZ
the
other
influences
in
society
.

The
tail
is
held
out
stiffly
so
that
it
acts
as
a
counterbalance	NN
.

Unless
specific
counter-measures	NNS
are
taken
,
unemployment
will
continue
to
rise

They
planned
to
overawe

counter-revolutionaries	NNS
through
sheer
mass
and
armed
might
.

gap

I
wonder
if
that

The

We

In

litigants
nearly
always
deceive	VB
their

She
deceived	VBD
me

They
try
to
deceive	VB
themselves

I
have
never
deceived	VBN
myself
about
the
merits

not
deceive	VB

He
decelerated	VBN

you

It

difficult

believe

the
logic

undeniable

deepening	VBG

gave
up

rather
than

was

The

a

To

therefore
the
gravest
form

Is
it
your

The

This

His

Sometimes

Was
this

the
heady

delusive	JJ
scent

Andrews

Ive
lived
in
a
small
house
whose
door
opened
directly	RB
onto
the
street
.

Shes
in
a
meeting
at
the
moment
but
she
will
be
here
directly	RB
.

Newly
married
girls
go
directly	RB
to
live
in
the
village
of
their
new
husband
.

Mr
Adrian
Oliver
,
director	NN
of
the
excavation
,
said
yesterday
that
work
was
progressing
well
...

He
became
artistic
director	NN
of
the
Sadlers
Wells
ballet
in
1978
.

She
was
the
newest
and
youngest
director	NN
on
the
board
...

He
had
a
connection
with
CIA
director	NN
William
J
.
Casey
.

I
talked
to
the
film
critic
and
television
director	NN
,
Christopher
Crook
.

...
the
first
meeting
of
a
new
directorate	NN
.

Ten
people
held
between
them
as
many
as
400
directorships	NNS
.

We
have
lots
of
dirt-cheap	JJ
pieces
of
technical
equipment
.

He
wiped
his
face
with
a
dirty	JJ
arm
...

Use
a
damp
sponge
to
remove
dirty	JJ
or
sticky
marks
from
the
walls
.

He
claimed
he
was
asked
to
do
a
dirty	JJ
job
for
the
government
...

They
even
played
a
dirty	JJ
trick
or
two
.

Shes
always
cheerful
,
in
spite
of
her
disabilities	NNS
.

The
disease
disables	VBZ
thousands
every
year
.

She
has
to
look
after
a
severely
disabled	JJ
relative
...

...
disabled	JJ
ex-servicemen
.

The
disabled	NNS
is
used
to
refer
to
people
who
are
disabled	NNS
.

There
are
some
extraordinary
chairs
for
the
disabled	NNS
nowadays
.

Well
,
I
think
I
can
disabuse	VB
you
of
that
notion
,
he
said
solemnly
.

This
inability
was
obviously
an
enormous
disadvantage	NN
...

The
disadvantage	NN
of
this
plan
was
that
it
needed
more
people
.

...
disadvantaged	JJ
children
...

...
disadvantaged	JJ
sections
of
the
community
.

These
factors
made
the
1976
agreement
disadvantageous	JJ
to
the
British
.

The
party
won
a
by-election
,
then
gained
four
disaffected	JJ
UP
members
.

I
disagree	VBP
completely
with
John
Taylor
...

I
disagree	VBP
with
much
of
what
he
says
...

You
know
he
and
I
disagree	VBP
about
it
...

Isnt
it
fairest
to
say
that
we
disagree	VBP
?

Benn
disagreed	VBD
with
the
abandonment
of
the
project
.

Oranges
and
chocolate
disagree	VBP
with
me
,
they
give
me
migraine
.

...
a
disagreeable	JJ
encounter
with
Mrs
Baggot
...

...
tests
which
are
disagreeable	JJ
,
humiliating
,
and
agonizing
.

There
were
some
disagreeable	JJ
people
around
,
it
was
true
...

Stop
being
so
disagreeable	JJ
!

They
are
divided
by
disagreements	NNS
about
specific
points
of
policy
...

I
guess
you
could
call
it
a
family
disagreement	NN
...

I
cant
recall
that
we
ever
had
a
serious
disagreement	NN
about
business
.

The
appeals
were
disallowed	VBD
by
the
electoral
court
.

I
saw
him
disappear	VBP
round
the
corner
...

She
disappeared	VBD
down
the
corridor
...

Diana
disappeared	VBD
to
heat
the
soup
.

I
used
to
disappear	VB
for
hours
up
high
trees
...

In
short
I
shall
disappear	VB
.
You
will
hear
nothing
from
me
again
.

Some
newspapers
are
going
to
disappear	VB
as
a
result
of
this
strike
...

His
approval
can
disappear	VB
as
fast
as
it
appears
...

After
all
,
it
was
only
the
dinosaurs
that
disappeared	VBD
,
not
the
whole
of
animal
life
.

No
one
would
enquire
too
closely
into
the
disappearance	NN
of
such
an
unimportant
person
.

He
mentioned
the
disappearance	NN
of
his
passport
to
the
manager
.

This
could
lead
to
their
total
disappearance	NN
within
fifty
or
sixty
years
.

The
answer
must
have
disappointed	VBN
him
...

You
disappoint	VB
me
:
I
had
expected
you
to
behave
more
responsibly
.

I
could
not
help
suspecting
that
it
would
disappoint	VB
Thomass
expectations
of
an
inheritance
.

He
was
disappointed	JJ
that
the
other
side
had
won
...

He
died
a
disappointed	JJ
man
...

I
was
disappointed	JJ
to
learn
that
the
fee
would
be
only
fifteen
pounds
.

The
results
have
generally
been
disappointing	JJ
...

They
have
been
somewhat
disillusioned
by
the
disappointing	JJ
progress
of
the
EEC
.

He
said
it
was
a
disappointment	NN
,
but
not
a
disaster
...

This
may
prove
a
disappointment	NN
to
the
party
.

Clarissa
gave
a
snort
of
disapproval	NN
...

He
has
never
disguised
his
disapproval	NN
of
the
President
.

The
other
directors
disapproved	VBN
of
his
methods
...

Why
cant
I
smoke?Because
I
disapprove	VBP
,
thats
why
.

...
a
group
of
women
with
disapproving	JJ
expressions
.

They
set
out
to
disarm	VB
the
various
terrorist
groups
.

He
argues
that
if
we
unilaterally
disarm	VB
then
they
will
do
likewise
.

Perhaps
it
was
the
French
accent
that
disarmed	VBD
her
.

Like
orthodox
Christianity
,
it
can
disarm	VB
all
criticism
by
reference
to
its
own
holy
writings
.

There
was
a
disarming	JJ
air
of
informality
.

Already
she
could
feel
the
wind
disarranging	VBG
her
hair
.

It
was
the
latest
in
a
string
of
hotel
disasters	NNS
...

She
was
in
Mexico
City
when
the
disaster	NN
happened
...

The
city
suffered
the
worst
US
air
disaster	NN
since
1979
.

Now
he
must
come
to
grips
with
the
disaster	NN
that
is
the
national
economy
...

His
last
day
at
work
was
a
disaster	NN
...

This
governments
policy
on
education
is
an
unmitigated
disaster	NN
.

In
1974
famine
came
in
the
wake
of
disastrous	JJ
floods
.

He
made
a
disastrous	JJ
attempt
to
direct
Antony
and
Cleopatra
.

He
had
refused
to
disavow	VB
his
attitudes
on
human
rights
.

After
twenty
years
the
organization
was
disbanded	VBN
...

They
began
to
disband	VB
.

There
is
no
reason
to
disbelieve	VB
him
...

I
never
disbelieved	VBD
their
story
.

I
have
always
disbelieved	VBN
in
telepathy
...

Can
you
disbelieve	VB
in
something
you
dont
know
about
?

During
1974
,
213m
was
disbursed	VBN
in
regional
development
grants
.

I
had
slipped
a
disc	NN
...

One
third
of
the
spine
is
made
up
of
these
discs	NNS
.

They
regularly
bought
one
or
more
discs	NNS
every
week
.

Should
they
discard	VB
the
present
system
entirely?
...

They
ate
food
discarded	VBN
by
the
soldiers
.

He
is
unable
to
discern	VB
what
is
actually
happening
...

It
is
impossible
to
discern	VB
the
extent
of
his
links
with
the
Mafia
.

I
could
dimly
discern	VB
his
figure
.

They
are
just
random
dots
.
There
is
no
discernible	JJ
shape
of
any
kind
.

She
had
a

He

He

The

48
hours
after
your

.

They
were
discharged	VBN
for
dishonesty
.

He
is
unable
to
discharge	VB
the
powers
and
duties
of
his
office
.

He
discharged	VBN
all
his
debts
before
he
died
.

One
female
insect
may

million

...
facilities
for
ships
to
discharge	VB

Next

...
the

of
mercury
from

Carbon
monoxide
discharge	NN

A

out
in
this
way
.

...
a
mild
cold
with
a
clear
nasal
discharge	NN
...

These
discharges	NNS
go
out
in
the
form
of
waves
.

Not
even
a
committed
disciple	NN
could
think
it
an
impressive
document
...

Lenin
was
the
disciple	NN
of
Marx
but
not
his
slave
.

Jesus
sent
two

the
disciples	NNS
on
ahead
.

...
the
disciplines	NNS
and
incentives

...

In
this
way
,
the
girls
learned
the
disciplines	NNS
of
motherhood
...

She
needs
the
discipline	NN
of
having
to
write
an
essay
every
week
.

Clearly
they
will
have
to
play
a
large
part
in
disciplining	VBG
themselves
.

Laura
was
not
disciplined	VBN
for
this
incident
...

The
company
is
not
going
to
discipline	VB

They

Northcliffes
attempt

disclose	VB
the
truth
was
systematically
blocked
.

The
screen
fell
back
with
a
crash
and
disclosed	VBD
a
yawning
opening
in

.

A
disclosure	NN
is
the
information

There
were
more

wrote
to
Mrs
Bullon
saying
she
was

be
disconnected	VBN

Then
the

I

He
sometimes

He
continued

His
unbearable
discords	NNS

more

I
could
take
.

The
suit

armour
on

seem

strike

They

He

discourteous	JJ
young

have
ever
met

I
realised
I
had
allowed
a
discourteous	RB
pause

Then
we
discovered	VBD
a
way

get
rid

it

He

discovered	VBN

He

actual
performance

She
dishonoured	VBD
him
by
taking

lover
.

There
is
something
very
dishonourable	JJ
about
him
.

I
think
it
is
dishonourable	JJ
to
maintain
your
seat
in
Parliament
under
the
circumstances
.

I
saw
this
really
dishy	JJ
bloke
down
at

Post
Office

I
hate
to
disillusion	VB

Many
social

disillusioned	JJ

My
father
was
now
thoroughly
disillusioned	JJ
with
me
...

He
was
not
bitter
,
just
disillusioned	JJ
.

Any
further
increase

would
be
a
disincentive	NN

I
was
disinclined	JJ
to
say
anything

anybody
.

Let
me
wash
those
cuts
and
disinfect	VB
them
.

Her
father
disowned

disinherited	VBD

As
a
minority
group

they
remain
trapped
,
disinherited	JJ

and
despised
.

They
had
seen
their
marriages

disintegrate	VB
under
its
influence
...

All
around
me
,
I
could
feel
morale
disintegrating	VBG
.

Both
ships
simply
seemed

The
bird
disintegrated	VBD

Governments

disinterest	NN

disinterested	JJ
groups

So
you
can
see
Im
a
disinterested	JJ
observer
.

Her
mother
had
always
been
disinterested	JJ
in
her
.

She
disliked	VBD
the
theatre

I
grew
to
dislike	VB
working
for
the
cinema

From
what
I
know
of
him
I
dislike	VBP
him
intensely
.

She
has
her
likes
and
dislikes	NNS
,
as
we
all
have
.

My
hip
felt
as
if
I
had
dislocated	VBN
it
.

The
whole
thing
was
dislocated	VBN
by
the
sudden
computer
failure
.

I
had
to
tug
quite
hard
in
order
to
dislodge	VB
the
hook
...

I
might
have
dislodged	VBN
the
earth

stones

I
moved
.

You
were
disloyal	JJ
to

country

he
replied
...

They
want
stronger
action
taken
against
disloyal	JJ
newspapers
.

Hunter
Road
was
miles
away

in
an
even
more
dismal	JJ
district

...
that
rather
dismal	JJ
melody
.

They
are
so
constructed
that
they
may
be
dismantled	VBN
if
necessary
.

Theyve
been
accused
of
dismantling	VBG

welfare
state

I
was
homesick
and
dismayed	VBD|VBN
by
the
quiet

country

Last
month
he
dismayed	VBN

refusing

You
can
dismember	VB
an
animal
as
large
as
a
cow

a
knife
like
that
.

Nor
was
England
about
to
dismember	VB
the
empire
of
the
previous
king
.

The
problems
can
no
longer
be
dismissed	VBN
...

Im
not
dismissing	VBG
this
as
a
thing
that
wasnt
worth
doing
...

We
shouldnt
dismiss	VB
them
just
because
theyre
old-fashioned
.

And
then
as
suddenly
as
the
idea
had
risen
,
he
dismissed	VBD
it
...

She
dismissed	VBD
him
from
her
mind
.

An
individual
cannot
now
be
dismissed	VBN
for
non-membership
of

Smollett
asked

the
charges
against
his
client

Her
lawyer
asked
to
have
the
case
dismissed	VBD
.

You
seemed
dismissive	JJ
of
him
,
too
.

The
police
officer
dismounted	VBN
from
his
bicycle
.

Peter
was
disobedient	JJ
to
his
parents
...

She
wore
the
air
of
a
disobedient	JJ
child
.

It
never
occurred
to
them
that
they
could
disobey	VB
their
parents
...

I
moaned
all
the
time
about
it
,
but
I
could
not
disobey	VB
...

His
orders
had
been
disobeyed	VBN
.

He
had
a
somewhat
spiteful
and
disobliging	JJ
nature
.

...
a
renewal
of
civil
disorders	NNS
in
several
cities
.

There
was
evidence
of
a
kidney
disorder	NN
...

...
a
specialist
in
various
forms
of
mental
disorders	NNS
.

There
were
too
many
things
in
the
small
disordered	JJ
room
.

More
training
in
the
care
of
mentally
disordered	JJ
patients
was
needed
.

They
go
upstairs
to
their
disorderly	JJ
bedroom
...

Her
belongings
now
lie
scattered
once
again
in
a
disorderly	JJ
mess
.

The
police
attempted
to
disperse
the
disorderly	JJ
crowd
.

Im
too
busy
.
Youll
disorganize	VB
my
whole
morning
schedule
.

It
was
a
bit
disorganized	JJ
,
but
there
were
one
or
two
very
fine
scenes
.

Her
father
disowned	VBD|VBN
and
disinherited
her
.

Other
newspapers
in
the
country
tended
to
disparage	VB
this
as
weak
liberalism
.

He
had
been
making
disparaging	JJ
remarks
about
Ottos
talents
.

...
a
link
between
these
very
disparate	JJ
aspects
of
scientific
research
...

The
level
of
talent
seems
so
disparate	JJ
.

The
disparity	NN
in
inflation
rates
in
1976
caused
many
problems
...

They
aim
to
reduce
economic
disparities	NNS
between
the
rich
and
poor
countries
.

The
dispassionate	JJ
observer
can
only
be
puzzled
by
this
phenomenon
.

The
supervisor
would
dispatch	VB
a
crew
to
repair
the
damage
...

The
cruiser
despatched
boats
to
rescue
the
survivors
...

My
sister
was
dispatched	VBN
to
our
grandmother
in
Scotland
.

The
emergency
required
the
dispatch	NN
of
special
forces
.

I
picked
up
the
paper
and
read
a
dispatch	NN
from
a
correspondent
in
Delhi
.

We
were
bringing
dispatches	NNS
from
Captain
Sydney
Smith
.

Im
sorry
to
have
to
dispel	VB
your
romantic
notions
...

All
such
doubts
were
now
dispelled	VBD
.

I
have
had
a
special
dispensation	NN
...

You
dont
even
have
to
obtain
a
dispensation	NN
.

They
are
better
off
under
the
new
dispensation	NN
.

The
charity
has
been
given
a
large
sum
of
money
to
dispense	VB
as
it
sees
fit
.

The
firm
has
been
dispensing	VBG
ointments
and
lotions
for
generations
...

...
a
dispensing	VBG
chemist
.

The
people
in
charge
of
health
and
welfare
had
ceased
to
dispense	VB
either
.

By
now
,
most
of
the
pieces
had
dispersed	VBD
on
the
tide
...

Building
tall
chimneys
to
disperse	VB
the
smoke
is
no
solution
at
all
.

I
had
seen
many
crowds
dispersed	VBD
by
policemen
...

The
foot
soldiers
rapidly
dispersed	VBD
and
vanished
into
the
woods
.

She
sounded
genuinely
dispirited	JJ
...

The
Party
is

whatever
you
like
with
it
.

What
are
you
doing	VBG
tonight?
...

He
just
sits
there
all
day
doing	VBG
nothing
.

They
promised
that
they
were
going
to
do	VB
something
about
immigration
...

Theres
nothing
I
can
do	VB
about
it
...

Were
doing	VBG
all
we
can
...

She
was
desperately
ill
and
very
little
could
be
done	VBN
for
her
.

Their
policies
have
done	VBN
more
harm
for
the
working
class
than
ours
...

They
are
afraid
of
what
it
might
do	VB
to
the
children
.

I
think
home
life
does	VBZ
a
lot
for
you
...

I
asked
Salman
Rushdie
what
winning
would
do	VB
for
his
career
as
a
novelist
...

That
hat
does	VBZ
nothing
for
you
.

What
do	VBP
you
want
to
do	VB
when
you
leave
school?
...

I
wonder
what
his
father
does	VBZ
.

I
didnt
do	VBP
very
well
in
my
exams
...

It
all
depends
how
the
Labour
Party
do	VBP
at
this
next
election
...

Well
done	VBN
,
Andrew
...

I
think
on
the
whole
we
dont
do	VBP
too
badly
.

Do	VBP
you
do	VBP
ferry
bookings
to
Ireland?
...

We
can
do	VB
travellers
cheques
.

We
havent
done	VBN
any
Shakespeare
yet
.

She
does	VBZ
a
marvellous
elderly
aunt
.

Ill
do	VBP
you
if
you
dont
stop
that
.

He
can
do	VB
120
miles
per
hour
in
that
car
.

This
pen
will
do	VB
...

Two
thousand
pounds
will
do	VB
me
very
well
.

Were
going
to
a
formal
do	VBP
tonight
.

Have
you
been
to
see
the
doc	NN
?

The
prisoners
were
grateful
and
docile	JJ
.

The
ship
entered
the
dock	NN
to
a
fanfare
of
trumpets
.

He
went
to
the
London
Docks	NNS
and
spent
two
days
trying
to
get
a
job
...

During
the
war
women
worked
on
the
farms
,
on
the
docks	NNS
and
in
the
factories
...

Much
of
the
vast
dock	NN
area
in
Glasgow
has
been
closed
.

It
was
raining
the
morning
they
docked	VBD
at
Southampton
...

I
sailed
slowly
because
I
didnt
want
to
dock	VB
my
boat
in
the
dark
.

He
explained
from
the
dock	NN
why
he
thought
his
parents
should
die
...

He
thought
about
the
other
people
who
should
have
been
in
the
dock	NN
at
his
side
.

His
wages
were
docked	VBN
to
pay
for
the
equipment
he
had
broken
...

She
lent
her
daughter
5
pounds
and
then
docked	VBD
her
pocket
money
until
the
debt
was
paid
off
.

He
drew
attention
to
the
rising
unemployment
among
dockers	NNS
.

He
stuffed
the
docket	NN
for
the
second
case
into
his
back
pocket
.

They
had
been
examined
,
categorized
,
docketed	VBD
.

He
lived
and
worked
in
the
Liverpool
dockland	NN
.

She
felt
so
ill
we
had
to
call
the
doctor	NN
...

I
went
to
see
Doctor	NN
Barker
this
morning
.

The
doctors	NNS
is
used
to
refer
to
the
surgery
or
clinic
where
a
doctor	NN
works
.

He
is
a
doctor	NN
of
philosophy
.

Im
sure
hes
doctored	VBN
the
figures
...

We
all
realized
the
play
needed
a
certain
amount
of
doctoring	VBG
.

...
Dr
Edwards
,
a
painter
with
a
doctorate	NN
in
art
,
psychology
and
education
.

Their
attitudes
were
condemned
as
doctrinaire	JJ
.

In
Britain
we
have
this
very
well-established
doctrine	NN
of
parliament
being
sovereign
...

...
his
ignorance
of
Christian
doctrine	NN
...

Their
doctrines	NNS
led
them
to
believe
in
their
own
moral
supremacy
.

He
studied
some
official
documents	NNS
relating
to
the
nineteenth
century
...

He
was
issued
with
travel
documents	NNS
which
allowed
him
to
fly
back
to
the
United
States
.

He
won
a
prize
for
documenting	VBG
the
horrors
of
war
in
different
African
countries
...

The
films
tried
to
document	VB
the
development
of
the
railways
...

These
incidents
are
the
first
documented	VBN
cases
of
shark
attacks
on
bathers
in
Australia
...

The
life
of
Byron
is
remarkably
well
documented	VBN
.

They
made
a
documentary	NN
about
the
life
of
William
Shakespeare
...

...
documentary	NN
films
.

She
was
doddering	JJ
and
frail
.

He
was
scrambling
to
his
feet
,
dodging	VBG
and
ducking
to
escape
more
blows
...

He
stopped
the
car
and
dodged	VBD
into
the
post
office
.

...
with
a
quick
dodge	NN
to
the
right
.

The
Minister
had
to
dodge	VBP
flying
tomatoes
.

This
issue
should
not
be
dodged	VBD
...

We
cannot
dodge	VBP
this
accusation
.

Hes
been
trying
to
dodge	VBP
going
to
school
by
pretending
to
be
ill
.

He
had
tried
all
sorts
of
dodges	NNS
to
avoid
being
called
up
.

Lets
go
on
the
dodgems	NNS
.

He
was
accused
of
being
a
tax
dodger	NN
.

Theres
something
dodgy	JJ
about
him
.

Its
a
rather
dodgy	JJ
plan
.

She
was
made
to
feel
like
an
inarticulate
dodo	NN
.

She
is
one
of
the
doers	NNS
of
this
world
.

Their
dog	NN
started
barking
at
me
.

He
let
her
down
,
the
dirty
dog	NN
.

Hes
been
dogging	VBG
me
all
day
.

Bad
luck
had
dogged	VBN
me
all
year
...

The
tour
was
dogged	VBN
by
injury
and
loss
of
confidence
.

He
had
no
time
for
political
or
other
dogmas	NNS
...

...
Christianity
in
the
early
days
when
there
was
less
dogma	NN
.

He
was
so
dogmatic	JJ
about
it
that
I
almost
believed
what
he
was
saying
...

His
friends
were
all
intensely
dogmatic	JJ
political
theoreticians
...

She
was
not
impressed
by
his
dogmatic	JJ
assertions
.

He
was
employed
as
a
general
dogsbody	NN
on
the
project
.

I
was
dog-tired	JJ
that
evening
.

He
gave
an
admiring
account
of
Larrys
doings	NN
.

How
much
is
the
dole	NN
now
,
20
quid?
...

There
was
no
dole	NN
for
farm
labourers
.

Things
are
getting
desperate
,
he
said
in
a
doleful	JJ
monotone
.

...
his
rapid
transformation
from
senator
to
doleful	JJ
night-club
comic
.

Whos
the
doll	NN
over
there
?

They
spent
half
a
million
dollars	NNS
on
the
campaign
...

Ethel
gave
him
a
dollar	NN
bill

The
pound
fell
more
than
25
per
cent
against
the

.

...
stew
with
beans
,
topped
up
with
a
dollop	NN
of
mashed
potato
.

He
was
too
busy
chasing
the
teenage
dollies	NNS
of
Paris
.

You
would
have
to
be
a
complete
dolt	NN
to
miss
the
turn-off
.

This
question
comes
into
the
domain	NN
of
philosophy
...

The
ultimate
responsibility
in
this
domain	NN
,
as
in
all
others
,
lay
with
the
chairman
.

His
domain	NN
extended
to
New
York
...

The
Arctic
remains

The

the
dome	NN

St
Peters
was
put
in
place
in
1590
...

...
the
huge
dome	NN
of
Central
Hall
.

A
band
of
frizzy
grey
hair
encircled
his
bald
dome	NN
.

...
a
typical
example
of
traditional
architecture
with
its
superb
domed	JJ
roofs
.

Everything
sounded
very
peaceful
and
domestic	JJ
...

He
was
not
prepared
to
sacrifice
this
principle
in
the
interests
of
domestic	JJ
harmony
.

She
was
never
a
very
domestic	JJ
sort
of
person
.

Should
the
women
quit
their
jobs
and
become
domestics	NNS
?

Our
ancestors
domesticated	VBN
various
plant
and
animal
species
.

She
took
me
to
what
was
apparently
her
own
domicile	NN
.

She
is
regarded
as
domiciled	JJ
in
the
UK
.

The
treaty
gave
them
dominance	NN
of
the
sea
routes
...

It
was
to
be
even
longer
before
their
dominance	NN
over
the
party
was
eroded
.

Agriculture
,
the
original
basis

lost
its

in
nation
after
nation

...
the
dominance	NN
of
economics
among
the
social

Chapter
three
examines
the
dominant	JJ
feature
of

...
the
television
experts
who
play
a
dominant	JJ
role
in
moulding
public
opinion

As
long
as
the
need
for
food

shelter
is
dominant	JJ
they
will
continue
to
work
.

She
is
the
dominant	JJ
partner
in
their
marriage
.

These
issues
dominated	VBD
the
election

That
sort
of
job
doesnt
dominate	VB
your
whole
existence
for
twenty-four
hours
a
day
.

This
nation
,
with
its
great
armies
,
seemed
likely
to
dominate	VB
the
whole
of
Western
Europe
.

The
older
women
were
not
permitted
to
dominate	VB
the
younger
male
members
of
the
family
.

The
valley
was
dominated	VBN
by
the
huge
Benedictine
abbey
.

He
was
a
rather
aggressive
and
dominating	JJ
character
.

Many
of
her
women
friends
also
had
domineering	JJ
husbands
.

...
a
Dominican	JJ
monk
...

At
the
Dominican	JJ
Church
I
joined
the
line
and
filed
inside
.

...
the
great
imperial
dominions	NNS
of
the
nineteenth
century
.

They
played
dominoes	NNS
all
night
.

The
other
two
men
donned	VBD
white
cotton
gloves
.

...
a
don	NN
at
the
Ankara
faculty
of
political
science
.

The
van
was
donated	VBN
to
us
by
a
local
firm
...

It
seemed
unfair
to
ask
my
family
to
donate	VB
money
to
such
a
project
.

They
received
a
large
donation	NN
from
one
of
the
unions
...

He
made
a
generous
donation	NN
to
our
campaign
fund
...

The
rest
of
the
money
we
get
from
donations	NNS
.

Much
was
made
of
the
donation	NN
of
this
sum
of
money
.

When
her
errand
was
done	VBN
she
ran
home
.

I
hope
youre
not
too
donnish	JJ
,
Tom
.

It
seemed
that
he
might
look
forward
to
a
donnish	JJ
life
devoted
to
private
study
.

There
is
still
a
shortage
of
kidney
donors	NNS

...
a
blood

About
half
this

comes
from

bequests
.

Pass
me
the
doodah	NN
will
you

He
made
a
few
doodles	NNS
with
a
ballpoint
on
the
back
of
the
bill
.

I
used
to
doodle	VB
on
my
papers
.

What
doomed	VBD
him
was
the
verdict
of
guilty
...

He
was
doomed	VBN
to
unemployment
by
his
ill-health
.

We
are
,
most
of
us
,
doomed	JJ
to
unhappiness

He
was
doomed	JJ
to
be
killed
in
a
car
crash
.

They
informed
the
Prime
Minister
that
his
government
was
doomed	JJ
...

He
was
a
propeller
maker
.
Now
that
is
a
doomed	JJ
trade
if
ever
there
was
one
.

As
they
passed
through
the
door	NN
,
they
saw
Tom
at
the
end
of
the
room
.

Ill
meet
you
outside
the
main
door	NN
at
ten
oclock
...

A
crowd
had
gathered
at
the
door	NN
.

Ever
since
then
youve
treated
me
like
a
doormat	NN
.

A
child
stood
in
the
doorway	NN

...
twelve
year
old
dope	NN
addicts

...
streets
free
of
crime
and
dope	NN
peddling
.

...
enough
dope	NN
to
knock
the
average
man
unconscious
.

We
got
the
dope	NN
on
the
latest
offer
from
Morgan
.

They
discovered
that
the
horse
had
been
doped	VBN
.

He
doped	VBD
her
drink
...

She
had
been
doped	VBN
and
kidnapped
.

The
girls
were
doped	VBN
to
the
eyeballs
...

They
are
all
so
doped	VBN
up
they
wouldnt
know
a
war
had
started
.

This
is
what
the
guy
means
,
isnt
it
,
you
dope	NN
...

What
did
that
dumb
dope	NN
mean
saying
it
was
nothing
important
?

Luckily
for
Louisa
she
just
felt
dopey	JJ
when
she
woke
up
the
next
morning
...

They
were
still
too
dopey	JJ

take
any
notice

Shes
all
right
,
but
her
brothers
a

dopey	JJ

Of

Feverish

Beneath

A

Countless

The
Duchess
of

doted	VBN

The
old
girl
is
slightly
dotty	JJ
...

She
really
could
be
very
dotty	JJ
sometimes
.

Her
uncle
was
still
dotty	JJ
about
roses
.

I
ordered
a
double	JJ
vodka
and
orange
.

A
bottle
of
whisky
was
produced
and
three
doubles	NNS
were
poured
.

The

population

The

its
birth
weight

about
five
months

She
doubled	VBD
the
blanket
before
putting
it
on
the
bed
.

My
first
job
was
as
Sophia
Lorens
double	NN
in
an
air-crash
scene
.

I
saw
your
double	NN
in
the
street
last
night
.

Her
secretary
doubled	VBD
as
her
housekeeper
...

This
bedroom
doubles	VBZ
as
a
study
.

The
tiny
animal
doubles	VBZ
,
stops

and
then
finally
runs
back

She
double-checked	VBD
her
bag
to
make
sure
shed
got
everything
.

In
spite
of
all
his
double-checks	NNS
,
he
hadnt
noticed
that
the
door
wasnt
locked

You
want
me
to
double-cross	VB
the
man
I
work
for
?

I
suddenly
realized
that
it
was
a
double-cross	NN
.

She
made
a
very
double-edged	JJ
remark
about
my
work
.

Is
it
really
worth
double-glazing	VBG
your

The
police
arrived
double-quick	RB

arrested
him

They

We
were
doubly	RB
disappointed
that
Jane
didnt
come
either
...

They
were
doubly	RB
confident
after
this
that
he
would
win
.

He
is
doubly	RB
disadvantaged
,
both
by
his
age
and
his
nationality
...

When
inflation
is
accompanied
by
unemployment
,
this
is
doubly	RB
true
.

There
was
still
a
doubt	NN
in
my
mind
...

Both
these
claims
raise
doubts	NNS
...

Frank
had
no
doubts	NNS
about
the
outcome
of
the
trial

...
but
we
have
serious
doubts	NNS
.

As
I
drove
to
East
London
I
had
moments
of
doubt	NN
that
I
was
doing
the
right
thing
.

I
very
much
doubt	VB
whether
they
knew

I
doubt	VBP
if
they
will
ever
want
vanilla
pudding
again
...

Maybe
he
changed
his
mind
,
but
I
doubt	VBP
it
...

I
began
to
seriously
doubt	VB
that
it
would
be
possible
to
elude
the
police
.

They
inwardly
doubted	VBD
the
facts
...

Some
of
our
members
doubt	VBP
the
value
of
demonstrations
...

He
had
the
courage
to
doubt	VB
,
where
all
the
others
piously
believed
.

Why
should
I
doubt	VBP
him?
...

I
apologized
for
having
doubted	VBD
his
word
.

The
organisation

a
doubtful	JJ

How

continue

was
doubtful	JJ

It
is
doubtful	JJ

doubtful	JJ
about

He
was
doubtful	JJ
that
he
could
ever
manage
it
...

Segal
is
doubtful	JJ
whether
were
meant
to
take
all
this
very
seriously
.

The
old

up

placed

the

When

it
was
with

dour	JJ
expression
.

Yes

said
Christopher

dourly	RB

He
doused	VBD
the
lamp

and
we
made
our

back

His

been
doused	VBN

She
had
doused	VBN
herself
with
perfume

There
were
white
doves	NNS

The

The

They

The

The
day
was
dragging	VBG

I

wonder

I
told

I

I
didnt
want

She
feels

She
thought

It

He
smiled

took

It

Slowly
the

Jacks
cheeks

He
felt
the
tension
drain	VB
out

Gradually
he
feels
his
reluctance
draining	VBG
away

The
project

already
draining	VBG

There

There

ache

The

appeared
in
March
as

been
promised
...

I
was
expecting
the
question
which
he
duly	RB
asked
.

She
was
deaf
and
dumb	JJ
from
birth
.

The
girl
stood
,
dumb	JJ
and
sullen
...

We
were
struck
dumb	JJ
with
horror
and
grief
.

They
used
to
call
you
dumb	JJ
if
you
worked
on
a
farm
.

Silence
can
upset
some
people
who
interpret
it
as
dumb	JJ
insolence
...

He
was
in
a
dumb	JJ
rage
.

All
they
bought
me
was
this
dumb	JJ
T-shirt
...

...
in
order
to
prevent
dumb	JJ
mistakes
later
on
.

They
had
watched
many
a
dumbbell	NN
turn
into
a
national
hero
on
the
baseball
pitch
.

He
was
watching
,
dumbfounded	JJ
,
when
suddenly
he
heard
a
scream
...

...
a
circle
of
dumbfounded	JJ
police
officers
.

Numb
with
fear
,
the
men
followed
dumbly	RB
the
order
to
sit
down
...

For
a
moment
he
stared
dumbly	RB
at
the
wall
.

I

They

She
dumped	VBD

Judys

They

Twelve
tons

have
been
discovered
on

The

was
hit
by

,
dun	JJ
stretch

He
was
such
a
dunce	NN

The
wind
carves
it
into
gulleys

later
into

dunes	NNS

They
were
driven

Just
dunk	VB
it
thoroughly
in
white
spirit

five
minutes
.

When
theyre
together
they
make
a
frightening
duo	NN
.

I
was
duped	VBN
into
opening
my
heart
and
expressing
my
thoughts
...

The
people
could
see
how
they
had
been
duped	VBN
.

I
couldnt
decide
whether
he
was
a
dupe	NN
or
a
scoundrel
.

This
stimulates
a
duplex	JJ
transaction
.

The
house
was
an
older
duplex	NN
encircled
by
nicely
shaped

...
an
oversight

would
allow
candidates

duplicate	VB

We
really
havent
duplicated	VBN

They
finally	RB
realized

the
whole

a
joke

Trotsky
lived

Whether

One
day

He

She

The

Each

The

The

A

Its

A
disturbing
conclusion
followed	VBN

I
learned
most

She

This

Fortunately
we
had
a

a
follow-on	NN
of
two
more
groups
the

This
wouldnt
halt

it

at

blunt

He

He
paced
up
and
down
,
fulminating	VBG
against
Thomas
.

His
awkwardness
made
him
fumble	VBP
with
the
key
...

He
fumbled	VBD
in
his
pocket
for
his
whistle
.

What
Im
fumbling	VBG
to
say
is
that
I
felt
different
about
you
.

Dont
bend
over
the
mixture
,
because
it
fizzes
and
fumes	VBZ
.

I
sat
there
fuming	VBG
...

This
is
your
doing
,
she
fumed	VBD
at
Jim
.

Your
things
will
probably
need
fumigating	VBG
.

She
was
very
young
,
pretty
,
and
great
fun	JJ
...

He
was
fun	JJ
to
be
with
sometimes
...

Theyre
both
full
of
fun	JJ
.

He
was
invited
to
attend
some
function	NN
at
his
uncles
house
.

Intelligence
is
partly
a
function	NN
of
the
speed
with
which
the
brain
processes
information
.

...
the
function	NN
keys
on
the
keyboard
.

John
has
a
very
good
idea
of
how
the
civil
service
functions	VBZ
,
because
he
has
been
part
of
it
...

Today
we
understand
almost
everything
about
the
functioning	VBG
of
the
heart
.

Quite
often
the
phone
didnt
function	VB
at
all
...

Only
one
hospital
is
functioning	VBG
.

The
brain
functions	VBZ
as
a
computer
...

I
was
amazed
to
find
myself
suddenly
functioning	VBG
as
an
ambassador
from
the
South
.

...
an
admirably
clear
and
functional	JJ
design
.

How
long
has
the
machine
really
been
functional	JJ
?

A
fund	NN
was
set
up
to
maintain
the
buildings
...

...
the
disaster
fund	NN
...

They
began
to
organize
a
fund	NN
for
the
women
.

...
a
large
fund	NN
of
scientific
and
technological
knowledge
...

They
have
a
fund	NN
of
experience
to
draw
on
.

The
work
is
being
funded	VBN
both
by
governments
and
private
industry
.

Lack
of
proper
funding	NN
is
making
our
job
more
difficult
.

...
the
fundamental	JJ
principles
on
which
society
is
based
...

...
a
grasp
of
fundamental	JJ
mathematical
concepts
...

Computers
are
fundamental	JJ
to
our
industrial
structure
.

There
is
a
fundamental	JJ
incompatibility
between
them
...

...
the
hollowness
and
fundamental	JJ
unsatisfactoriness
of
this
way
of
life
...

The
differences
are
in
some
respects
fundamental	JJ
.

This
will
bring
about
fundamental	JJ
changes
in
society
...

...
the
fundamental	JJ
revolution
in
human
values
that
has
occurred
.

The
Administration
is
making
a
fundamental	JJ
error
in
confusing
spending
with
extravagance
.

Its
fundamentally	RB
a
political
satire
...

Our
criminal
code
is
based
fundamentally	RB
on
fear
...

Yet
,
fundamentally	RB
,
we
are
not
a
part
of
the
community
.

They
have
fundamentally	RB
altered
the
rationale
for
military
spending
...

I
disagreed
fundamentally	RB
with
what
the
Party
stood
for
.

Today
is
Arthurs
funeral	NN
...

Theyre
having
a
funeral	NN
service
at
eleven
.

The
atmosphere
in
the
cabin
was
almost
unbearably
funereal	JJ
.

I
promised
to
take
them
to
the
funfair	NN
on
Saturday
...

...
a
funfair	NN
Ghost
Train
.

A
man
who
will
climb
a
cliff
may
funk	VB
grasping
a
snake
...

We
had
our
chance
then
,
and
funked	VBD
it
.

Maurice
spoke
,
hesitating
,
not
wanting
to
seem
a
funk	NN
.

...
medicines
which
he
had
transferred
through
a
funnel	NN
from
the
bottles
.

The
ravine
was
a
funnel	NN
for
winds
...

Try
making
a
funnel	NN
of
your
hands
.

The
smoke
was
pouring
from
the
funnel	NN
.

...

funnelling	VBG
effect
of
bays

Icy

down

streets

They
were
planning
to
funnel	VB
aid

the
resistance

She
was
walking

bit
funnily	RB

Shes
a

funny	JJ
sometimes

a
little
pink
jacket
edged
with
white
fur	NN
...

...
a
fur	NN
coat

The
dog
was
excited
by
the
smell
of
the
furs	NNS
they
had
been
packing
.

...
a
Russian
hat
in
black
nylon
fur	NN
.

She
had
been
accused
of
stealing
furs	NNS
from
a
department
store
.

An
iron
sometimes
furs	VBZ
up
like
a
kettle
and
needs
cleaning
.

...
my
freshly
furbished	VBN
dining
room
.

I
was
furious	JJ
and
told
them
to
get
out
of
my
house
...

He
was
furious	JJ
with
himself
for
not
realizing
it
sooner
.

We
could
predict
which
horse
would
win
over
five
furlongs	NNS
.

His
job
was
to
stoke
the
furnace	NN
.

The
room
,
which
had
been
so
icy
in
winter
,
was
now
a
furnace	NN
.

He
wanted
to
be
moved
to
a
nursing
home
where
he
could
furnish	VB
his
own
room
.

They
were
not
willing
to
furnish	VB
the
necessary
troops
...

Luckily
,
they
have
furnished	VBN
us
with
a
translation
.

We
are
looking
for
furnished	JJ
accommodation
in
the
centre
of
town
.

The
bedroom
was
scantily
furnished	JJ
...

She
lived
in
a
poorly
furnished	JJ
flat
.

The
half-hour
lecture
caused
an
enormous
furore	NN
...

...
the
present
furore	NN
over
drugs
.

...
a
field
with
parallel
furrows	NNS
running
down
it
.

Generations
of
bare
feet
had
worn
a
furrow	NN
in
the
floor
.

I
could
tell
from
the
deep
furrows	NNS
in
her
forehead
that
she
was
very
disturbed
by
the
news
.

The
pain
of
the
disease
caused
him
habitually
to
furrow	VB
his
brow
...

Sutherlands
brow
furrowed	VBD
.

A
bullet
furrowed	VBD
the
wall
beside
him
.

The
lemur
has
yellow
eyes
and
a
long
furry	JJ
tail
.

Barbara
looked
smart
in
a
furry	JJ
coat
.

Now
,
however
,
the
government
are
keen
to
take
the
matter
further	RBR
...

The
art
of
the
1970s
went
further	RBR
,
abandoning
tradition
...

They
never
got
any
further	RB
.

I
shall
go
further	RBR
and
say
that
Lawrence
was
playing
a
double
game
...

I
wouldnt
want
to
take
it
any
further	RBR
at
this
stage
.

Davis
related
that
the
three
girls
were
pretty
;
further	RB
,
that
before
the
ship
sailed
they
had
all
acquired
admirers
...

He
argued
that
the
freedom
to
join
a
union
does
not
also
imply
a
freedom
not
to
join
.
He
further	RB
argued
that
the
1980
Act
would
protect
workers
more
.

...
at
the
further	JJ
end
of
the
table
.

It
has
its
origins
much
further	RBR
back
in
time
...

Three
years
further	RBR
on
,
Linda
has
no
regrets
...

Looking
further	RBR
ahead
,
airfields
were
to
be
built
.

I
wont
detain
you
further	RBR
.

We
are
no
longer
able
to
further	VB

cause

Morris

massive
subsidies

cover
deficits
incurred
in
the
furtherance	NN
of

We
made
our
way

She
sat
near
the
furthest	JJS
window
.

...
the
fields
which
lay
furthest	RB
from
his
farm
...

It
was
often
those
without
charts
who
got
the
furthest	RB
.

Fear
showed
in
his
eyes
,
in
the
furtive	RB
darting
of
his
gaze
.

Switch
off
lamp

mend

Has
the
fuse	NN
blown
then
?

As
usual
,
several
of
the
street
lamps
had
fused	VBN
...

If
the
wires
had
met

would
have

a
rich
fusion	NN
of
several
elements
.

What
is
all
the
fuss	NN
about?
...

The
meeting
ended
without
too
much
fuss	NN
.

Stop
fussing	VBG
,
Mary
,
and
come
here
...

He
was
a
nuisance
,
always
fussing	VBG
and
worrying
...

Shes
always
fussing	VBG
about
her
appearance
.

She
is
in
a
fuss	NN
because
her
mothers
coming

She
gets
into
a

when
things
go
wrong

Theres
certain

Tim

Sit

I
hope
youre
not
fussy	JJ
about
garlic
.

Feeling
over-anxious
and
fussy	JJ
I
began
to
question
her
further
.

I
was
sent
to
a
fusty	JJ
old
school
in
the
country
.

The
sleeping
bag
smelt
fusty	JJ
.

...
a
series
of
costly
and
futile	JJ
wars

Luciana
knew
from
experience
how
futile	JJ
it
was
to
argue
with
her
father
.

She
kept
making
futile	JJ
remarks
while
I
was
trying
to
concentrate
on
the
lecture
.

Industrial
unrest
will
continue
into
the
foreseeable
future	NN
...

We
will
have
to
see
what
the
future	NN
holds

The
offices

may
well
have
no
typewriters

They
look
to
the
future	NN
with
a
certain
anxiety
.

Lets
meet
again
at
some
future	JJ
date

...
the
need

conserve
energy
for
future	JJ
generations

She
stored
it
all
away
for
her
own
future	JJ
reference
.

We
have
the
future	NN
to
think
of
...

The
future	NN
was
obscure
and
peace
was
not
yet
in
sight

We
need
to
face
the
future	NN
.

They
have
to
find
their
own
way
to
whatever
political
future	NN
they
might
choose

I
decided
that
my
future	NN
lay
in
medicine

Im
convinced
that
there
is
a
sound
future	NN
in

Members

the
public
might
wonder
if
this
scheme

any

No

The

There

an
inability

She
took

drank
half

After
the
play
he
delivered
a
long
harangue	NN
about
how
dreadful
the
English
theatre
was
...

Whenever
they
started
their
harangues	NNS
,
he
simply
sat
back

stopped
listening
.

Smith
harangued	VBD
his
fellow

One

at

Some

have
chosen
to
harass	VB

He
stated
that
unless
I
ceased
harassing	VBG
Sir
William
he
would
not
be
prepared
to
defend

harassed	JJ
working

will
continue

As
the
pressure
gets
worse

people
get
more
harassed	JJ
and

is
rushed

I
have
had
a
particularly
busy

The

harboured	VBD

She
begins
to
harbour	VB
resentments

turn

You
must
remember
that
she
has
broken

that
you
could
get
into
trouble

When

He
listened
hard	RB

could
hear

Think
hard	RB
about

Im

.

She
slammed
the

hard	RB
behind
us

Check
that
the

is
tight
by
tugging

hard	RB
.

Give
it
a
hard	JJ
push
.

We
laughed
so
hard	RB
she
wondered
what
she
had
said
wrong

...
a
baby
who
cries
hard	RB
every
afternoon

At

I
hurried
off

It

I
was
horrified	VBN

do

Both
Mr.
Faulds

They
will
never
forget
the
blood

horror	NN
of

battle

Sometimes
his
mind
would
dwell
on
the
horrors	NNS
he
had
been
through
.

Davenport
House
is
the
horror	NN

Come

Did

Roland
was
horror-stricken	JJ
at
what
hed
done
.

He
was
seen
riding
a
horse	NN
through
the
streets
of
London
...

In
the
early
twentieth
century
the
internal
combustion
engine
replaced
the
horse	NN
.

She
saw
a
picture
of
Piccadilly
almost
jammed
with
horse-drawn	JJ
traffic
in
about
1875
.

Horsemen	NN
would
arrive
and
tether
their
horses
to
the
rail
...

He
was
sent
to
Curragh
Camp
in
Ireland
because
he
was
such
a
fine
horseman	NN

climate

It
seems
to
make
the
soil
more
alkaline

more
hospitable	JJ

.

I

I
said
that
her
mother
was
hospitalized	VBN
and
that
the
situation
was
grave
...

The
most
effective
way
of
stopping
this
is
to
hospitalize	VB
him
for
a
brief
period
.

There

We

I

.

People
are
much
too
obsessed
with
their
own
inadequacies	NNS
to
be
really
concerned
about
yours
.

His
income
is
inadequate	JJ
to
meet
his
basic
needs
...

He
had
eaten
an
inadequate	JJ
and
hurried
lunch
...

Their
evidence
was
inadequate	JJ
and
confusing
.

We
were
apparently
too
inadequate	JJ
to
join
his
exclusive
club
...

He
makes
me
feel
totally
inadequate	JJ
.

The
suffering
is
inadvertent	JJ
and
unwanted
.

It
is
inadvisable	JJ
to
plant
lettuces
too
early
.

...
personal
freedom
,
the
inalienable	JJ
right
to
do
anything
you
want
.

The
phrase
seemed
inapplicable	JJ
to
the
tall
young
man
.

I
arrived
with
a
small
suitcase
full
of
inappropriate	JJ
clothes
...

...
foreign
ideas
inappropriate	JJ
to
the
Third
World
.

He
found
it
inappropriate	JJ
for
a
former
President
to
engage
in
conversation
with
a
convicted
criminal
.

His
parents
were
dull
and
inarticulate	JJ
...

He
became
inarticulate	JJ

his
anger

.

...
the
Presidents
inaugural	JJ
speech

We
held
a
number
of
successful
inaugural	JJ
meetings
of
the
new
party
in
the
area
.

She
was
invited
over
to
inaugurate	VB
the
first
British
womens
temperance
conference
.

This
kind
of
fear
is
something
thats
inbred	JJ
in
us
.

The
child
has
got
an
inbuilt	JJ
feeling
of
inferiority
...

This
kind
of
thinking
has
inbuilt	JJ
limitations
.

The
loss
to
the
race
as
a
whole
is
incalculable	JJ
...

...
a
hatred
that
could
have
incalculable	JJ
consequences
in
the
decades
ahead
.

She
would
go
into
a
trance
and
wail
her
incantations	NNS
to
the
spirits
.

He
is
incapable	JJ
of
understanding
...

The
administration
is
incapable	JJ
of
putting
any
plan
into
effect
.

I
had
believed
him
to
be
incapable	JJ
of
lying
...

...
a
woman
incapable	JJ
of
murder
.

...
a
lonely
,
incapable	JJ
,
fragile
woman

Hes
both
incapable	JJ
and
dishonest
.

...
tobacco
and
alcohol
which
kill
or
incapacitate	VBP
tens
of
thousands
each
year
.

Growing
incapacity	NN
is
expected
with
increasing
age
...

...
her
incapacity	NN
to
forgive
herself
.

She
was
to
be
incarcerated	VBN
in
a
cell
by
herself
.

...
evil
incarnate	JJ
...

They
made
me
out
to
be
that
hideous
reality
incarnate	JJ
.

...
Miss
Lenaut
,
that
incarnation	NN
of
feminine
beauty
...

He
became
the
incarnation	NN
of
evil
.

Perhaps
they
were
lovers
in
a
previous
incarnation	NN
...

Christians
insist
upon
only
one
incarnation	NN
.

The
proposed
pay
freeze
has
incensed	VBN
the
men
.

Money
is
being
used
as
an
incentive	NN
...

He
had
no
necessity
to
write
,
and
therefore
no
incentive	NN
to
go
on
practising
his
spelling
...

At
present
there
are
few
incentives	NNS
for
landowners

improve

Profit
restriction
can
destroy
incentive	NN

motivation

He
has
been
associated
with
Everyman
Opera
since
its
inception	NN
in

centuries

almost
incessant	JJ
warfare

the
incessant	JJ
demand

Its

rather
boring
set

incestuous	JJ
people

Five

had
fallen

The
car
moved

You

Howard
inched	VBD

There
is
a
high
incidence	NN
of
heart
disease
among
middle-aged
men
.

She
told
us
about
some
of
the
amusing
incidents	NNS
of
her
holiday
.

A
serious
incident	NN
along
the

increased
our
fears

As

So
I
agreed

lend
him

incidentally	RB
he
still
hasnt
paid
me

The

His

was
clear

incisive	JJ

...
an
intelligent

incisive	JJ
critique

our
society

How
free
can
free
speech
get
before
it
threatens
society
by
inciting	VBG
it
to
riot?
...

They
claimed
we
were
inciting	VBG
people
against
the
Government
.

He
was
accused

inciting	VBG
violence

People

There
was

natural

She
says
her
large

He
went

There

According
to
one
insider	NN
,
the
government
is
getting
very
worried
.

The
leaflets
were
a
more
insidious	JJ
form

this
insidious	JJ
kind
of
suppression

The
idea
itself
may

He

.

Even
the
most
insignificant	JJ
part
of
the
problem
ought
to
be
carefully
considered
...

The
proportion
of
Indian
capital
in
the
project
was
relatively
insignificant	JJ
...

Who
were
these
nationalists
?
Merely
an
insignificant	JJ
minority
.

He
insinuated	VBD
that
my
wife
had
betrayed
my
trust
in
her
...

He
destroyed
the
witnesss
character
by
insinuating	VBG
base
motives
to
his
actions
.

He
eventually
insinuated	VBD
himself
into
a
key
position
in
the
Party
...

The
past
invariably
insinuates	VBZ
itself
into
our
present
life
...

He
wishes
to
insinuate	VB
suspicion
and
hatred
into
the
mind

people
.

It
may
seem
insipid	JJ

She

But
you
know

the

insisted	VBD

You
must
help
her.
...

What
have
you
been
doing

I
insist	VBP

He
insisted	VBD

Most
universities
insist	VBP

I
insisted	VBD
on
a
contract
that
gave
me
some
sort

security
.

He
was
insistent	JJ
that
we
should
have

There
have
been
insistent	RB
demands
that
more

She

nasty
common

The

She
inspected	VBD

She
mended
the

and
then
held
it
up

China
has
been
the
inspiration	NN
for
a
new

distinct
ideological
growth

He
was
later

American
comic
strip
character

Superman
.

I
had
an
inspirationwhy
not
take

...

He
paused
,
searching
for
inspiration	NN
.

The
book
was
of
the
greatest
inspirational	JJ
value
.

Not
even
Churchills
vision
could
inspire	VB
the
Party

reform
...

They
were
in
too
gloomy
a
mood
to
be
inspired	VBN
by
his
enthusiasm
...

The
strikes
appear
to
be
politically
inspired	VBN
...

Pizzaro
had
the
example
of
Cortes
to
inspire	VB
and
guide
him
.

He
had
the
assured
voice
of
a
man
who
inspired	VBD
confidence

Successful
officers
have
the
capacity
to
lead
others

to
inspire	VB
respect

their
followers
.

As
an
architect
,
he
was
an
inspired	JJ
amateur
.

I
think
I
can
make
an
inspired	JJ
guess
...

Many
people
prefer
mathematical
probabilities
to

guess-work

It
was
an
inspiring	JJ
occasion

Every
line

Its
so

I
do
not

the
doctor

right

Pollock

Bal
hesitated
for

It
was
all
gone

An
instant	NN
later
his
body
was

They

an
angry
buzzing

you
do

two
ago
,
I
had
an
invitation	NN
to
go
and
talk
to
the
cadets
at
West
Point
.

It
was
an
invitation	NN
to
love

She
declined
the
invitation	NN
to
address
him
as
Charles
.

I
asked
my
director
to
invite	VB
her
to
the
party
...

He
had
been
invited	VBN
for
dinner
at
Julies
house
...

Its
very
kind
of
you
to
invite	VB
me
.

I
was
invited	VBN
by
a
friend
to
attend
meetings
of
a
youth
organization
...

He
was
invited	VBN
for
interview
at
Leeds
...

We
were
invited	VBN
to
sit
on
committees
...

I
was
invited	VBN
to
become
the
first
woman
Chancellor
.

To
speak
of
it
to
others
would
invite	VB
danger
...

This
appeasement
policy
invites	VBZ
disaster
...

A
premature
general
strike
would
invite	VB
total
defeat
.

We
need
to
photocopy
another
twenty
invites	NNS
.

The
place
where
they
landed
was
green
and
inviting	JJ
...

She
had
large
dark
eyes
,
shy
but
inviting	JJ
...

This
was
an
inviting	JJ
idea
...

He
could
smell
their
inviting	JJ
aroma
.

He
chanted
continuous
invocations	NNS
...

They
murmured
invocations	NNS
to
the
gods
.

All
they
did
was
file
the
odd
document
and
invoice	NN
...

No
invoices	NNS
had
been
found
for
any
of
the
goods
.

Have
they
invoiced	VBD
us
for
the
stationery
yet
?

She
had
invoked	VBN
the
law
in
her
own
defence
...

The
Government
invoked	VBD
the
Emergency
Powers
Act
...

Most
people
assumed
that
I
would
invoke	VB
the
Fifth
Amendment
.

These
principles
were
invoked	VBN
in
opposition
to
proposals
for
financial
reform
.

They
did
their
best
to
invoke	VB
popular
enthusiasm
for
the
war
...

...
nursery
rhymes
that
invoke	VB
memories
of
my
childhood
...

In
his
new
work
,
he
invokes	VBZ
an
atmosphere
of
careless
rapture
.

Gods
will
be
invoked	VBN
,
spirits
raised
,
rituals
carried
out
.

She
took
an
involuntary	JJ
step
towards
him
...

Ugh
!
he
exclaimed
with
an
involuntary	JJ
shudder
...

There
were
one
or
two
involuntary	JJ
exclamations
.

Workers
are
never
told
about
things
which
involve	VBP
them

...
a
project
involving	VBG
206
families
.

I
was
reluctant
to
involve	VB
myself
in
this
private
fight
...

They
continue
to
involve	VB
themselves
deeply
in
community
affairs
.

His
real
achievement
was
to
involve	VB
the
trade
unions
in
plans
for
modernisation
...

I
told
her
to
get
in
touch
with
you
,
but
she
didnt
want
to
involve	VB
you
...

Did
you
have
to
involve	VB
me
in
this

ability
of

We

discussions

Its
terribly
involvedI
cant

The
problems
a
little
bit
more
involved	JJ
than
I
suggested
.

She
got
involved	JJ
with
lots
of
lovers
...

He
had
become
involved	JJ
with
her
when
they
were
in
Brussels

...
parental
involvement	NN
in
primary
schools

He
avoids
involvement	NN
in
the
political
life
of
his
community
...

Its
not
unfair
to
question
the
Americans
involvement	NN
...

...
the
active
involvement	NN
of
thousands
of
people
in
the
election
campaign
.

Both
agreed
that
it
was
not
to
be
a
lasting
involvement	NN
.

The
Count
had
come
to
think
himself
invulnerable	JJ
...

The
strategic
nuclear
submarine
is
almost
invulnerable	JJ
.

He
was
constantly
preoccupied

I

The

You

changed

He
wrote
out
an
IOU	NN
for
five

We

You

Many

The

During

Buddys

The

then
with
a
jolt	NN

You

bright
light

I
was
jolted	VBN
out

my
exhaustion

piercing
screams
in
the
next
room

It
jolted	VBD
me

I
jot	VBP
odd
notes
in
the
back
of
the
diary
.

His
sympathy
for
causes
that
could
not
benefit
him
one
jot	NN
was
easily
roused
...

In
the
long
run
it
does
not
matter
a
jot	NN
that
Dolores
had
been
deprived

childhood

I
looked
up

had

a
jotter	NN
.

For
the
purpose
of
writing

I
picked
up
a
journal	NN
from
the
shelf

I
got
a
job
as
editor
of
a
trade
journal	NN

For
nearly
three
months
he
had
been
keeping
a
journal	NN
of
his
travels
around
Europe

She
worked
as
a
journalist	NN
on

He
went

straightaway
after

long
journey	NN

He
landed
on
the
west
coast
and
journeyed	VBN
for
several
weeks
over
rough
roads
...

The
nights
became
colder
as
they
journeyed	VBD
north
.

The
printing
press
employed
a
small
number
of
journeymen	NN

apprentices

an

heavy
jowls	NNS
and
a
double
chin
.

She
discovered
the
joy	NN
of
writing
...

His
one
joy	NN
is
playing
squash
...

Her
sheer
professionalism
made
her
a
joy	NN
to
watch
.

The
total
effect
is
so
intensely
joyful	JJ
that
it
comes
across
like
dance
therapy
...

I
still
felt
sad
even
after
youd
announced
the
joyful	JJ
tidings

I
think
she
has
got
something
serious
as
well
as
joyful	JJ
to
offer
young
people

The
joyful	JJ
parents

life

I
hope
I
never
become
as
joyless	JJ
as
they
have
become
.

That
joyride	NN
,
I
grant
you
,
was
a
silly
stunt

out

Judge	NN
Arnason
set

Davis
free

The
judge	NN
ruled
that
those
statements
could
not
be
allowed
as
evidence
.

The
panel
of
judges	NNS
consisted
of
a
variety
of
famous
people

The
judges	NNS
decision
is
final
and
no
correspondence
will
be
entered
into
.

He
knew
Muller
would
be
a
good
judge	NN
of
character

Nick
,
a
perfect
judge	NN
of
such
matters
,
had
ordered
a
light
French
wine
.

I
have
been
judging	VBG
village
flower
shows
and
gardens
for
nearly
thirty
years
...

The
competition
was
judged	VBN
by
the
local
mayor
.

Its
impossible
to
judge	VB
her
age
...

It
was
difficult
to
judge	VB
the
seriousness
and
depth
of
their
commitment
...

Id
judge	VB
that
there
are
fifteen
rooms
in
that
house
...

How
will
they
judge	VB
which
is
likely
to
be
the
most
reliable
?

I
saw
him
on
his
bed
in
pain
and
judged	VBN
him
unfit
to
move
around
...

A
person
is
judged	VBN
to
be
clever
if
they
answer
the
questions
in
the
right
way
...

The
operation
must
so
far
be
judged	VBN
a
failure
...

He
judged	VBN
it
wiser
to
put
a
stop
to
this
quarrel
.

She
seemed
to
be
watching
him
,
judging	VBG
him
...

Social
workers
declare
that
they
are
not
out

simply

help

from
the
findings

this
animal

immune

There
was
some
great
national
celebration
in

firework

The
new
king
was
attractive
,
to
judge	IN
from

I
felt
completely
unable
to
come
to
any
judgement	NN
about
it
at
all
...

I
shall
make
my
own
judgement	NN
on
this
matter
when
I
see
the
results.
...

My
personal
judgement	NN
is
that
it
will
be
absolutely
essential
to
sell
the
business.
...

In
our
judgment
,
her
plan

definitely
succeeded

The
final
judgment

made

chided
their

not

Of

Im
worried

Youre
turning
into
a
junkie	NN

Their
decision
was

was
sworn

Ive
just	RB
sold
my
car

She
had
only
just	RB
moved

Yes
,
I
just	RB
heard
yesterday
...

I
thought
of
you
just	RB
a
second
ago
.

Im
just	RB
coming...
Im
just	RB
making
us
some
coffee
,
Chris
...

They
were
just	RB
about
to
leave
when
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
.

I
dont
want
you
to
ask
any
questions
just	RB
at
the
moment
.

The
expression
just	IN
as
is
used
to
say
that
one
thing
happened
at
exactly
the
same
time
as
something
else
.

These
are
just	RB
a
few
of
the
enquiries
which
may
come
in
...

Thats
just	RB
one
aspect
of
my
work
.

They
were
just	RB
thirty
yards
away

Brandt
was
just	RB
eighteen
when
Hitler
came

If

I
could

Just	RB
listen

noise

Albert

what

opportunity

I
think
we
all
look
very
smart.Dont
we
just!
...

Hes
a
good
talker
,
isnt
he?Isnt
he
just	RB
.

We
were
prepared
for
just	RB
this
eventuality
...

Ive
been
waiting
for
just	RB
such
an
occasion
...

Thats
just	RB
what
I
wanted
to
hear
.

Ah
yes
,
I
can
just	RB
see
him
as
a
dentist
...

What
a
wonderful
description

I
can
just	RB
smell
the
sea
air

Oh
,
I
can
just	RB
taste
that
gorgeous
cheese
.

I
wonder
if
we
can
just	RB
turn
our
attention
to
something
you
mentioned
earlier
...

Can
I
just	RB
use
your
lighter
,
Ive
run
out
of
matches
...

If
you
can
just	RB
sign
there
please
.

I
believe
my
Sam
here
would
be
just	RB
the
person!
...

He
knew
just	RB
the
place
.

That
will
be
just	RB
forty
pounds
.

He
stuck
the
knife
right
in
,
just	RB
here
...

...
just	RB
opposite
St
Georges
Square
.

Rattlesnake
is
just	RB
like
chicken
,
only
tougher
...

Ive
received
just	RB
the
same
orders
as
you
have
...

She
was
just	RB
as
fat
as
he
was
and
just	RB
as
unattractive
.

Let
us
be
cautious
in
our
actions
,
cautious
but
just	JJ
...

...
an
orderly
,
just	JJ
,
and
civilised
society
.

...
the
difference
between
a
just	JJ
and
an
unjust
cause
...

...
a
just	JJ
war
.

It
would
be
much
more
satisfactory
if
new
ideas
were
the
just	JJ
reward
for
hard
work
and
persistent
effort
...

Do
you
think
that
imprisonment
represents
a
just	JJ
or
an
unjust
punishment
?

I
hope
this
is
a
justifiable	JJ
interpretation
...

I
couldnt
even
call
it
a
justifiable	JJ
Womens
Lib
attitude
.

What
is
the
social
justification	NN
of
University
Education?
...

We
all
have
sound
justifications	NNS
for
what
we
do
...

There
was
no
justification	NN
for
higher
interest
rates
...

It
could
be
said
,
with
some
justification	NN
,
that
the
choice
has
already
been
made
.

I
think
he
was
quite
justified	JJ
in
refusing
to
help
her
.

In
these
circumstances
,
massive
industrial
action
is
justified	JJ
and
necessary
.

Our
latest
model
offers
a
facility
for
justified	JJ
margins
.

The
decision
has
therefore
been
fully
justified	VBN
...

Research
programmes
almost
always
justify	VB
themselves
by
producing
some
pattern
or
other
...

Such
measures
are
easily
justified	VBN
and
meet
with
approval
.

So
how
did
they
justify	VB
putting
the
thing
on
a
gallery
wall?
...

Im
not
going
to
try
and
justify	VB
or
excuse
myself
...

She
had
no
need
to
justify	VB
herself

stern

opened
the
locker
and
took
out
the
lifejackets	NNS
and
threw
them
over
the
side
...

They
were
without
radios
,
life-jackets
,
or
even
compasses
.

...
the
lifeless	JJ
body
of
Lieutenant
Dowling
.

...
a
time
when
the
earth
was
completely
lifeless	JJ
...

...
a
barren
and
lifeless	JJ
land
.

The
Mackinnon
household
became
my
lifeline	NN
,
my
only
link
with
the
outside
world
...

...
the
oil
lifeline	NN

Europe

They
arranged
to
have
a
life-size	JJ
inflatable
whale
float
down
the
Thames
.

In
our
brief
life-span
we
normally
experience
only
a
few
of
these
problems
...

A
foxs
natural
lifespan	NN
could
be
ten
years
.

This
job
had
a
planned
life-span
of
five
years
...

...
shortening
the
lifespan	NN
of
its
components
.

I
have
spent
a
lifetime	NN
in
politics
...

Ive
seen
a
lot
of
changes
in
my
lifetime	NN
.

...
during
the
lifetime	NN
of
this
parliament
.

The
man
lifted	VBD
a
pile
of
books
from
the
bedside
table
...

He
lifted	VBD
the
glass
to
his
mouth
...

One
by
one
,
she
lifted	VBD
down
the
wooden
boxes
in
which
the
eggs
were
packed
...

Reaching
inside
,
he
lifted	VBD
the
baby
out
with
both
hands
.

He
lifted	VBD
his
hand
to
ring
the
doorbell
...

He
lifts	VBZ
his
foot
from
the
accelerator
...

Hargreaves
lifted	VBD
his
bad
leg
and
eased
it
to
a
better
position
.

He
lifted	VBD
his
eyes
from
the
table
...

After
a
while
she
lifted	VBD
her
head
and
stared
out
of
the
window
.

She
lifted	VBD
her
voice
for
the
children
to
hear
.

I
took
the
lift	NN
to
the
eighth
floor
...

There
was
a
man
in
the
lift	NN
as
we
went
down
...

The
lift	NN
doors
opened
,
and
they
stepped
out
into
the
empty
corridor
.

He
gave
her
a
lift	NN
back
to
London
that
night
...

Try
and
get
a
lift	NN
with
them
.

There
is
a
restriction
on
the
number
of
passengers
foreign
airlines
can
lift	VB
from
the
island
.

They
urged
the
United
States
to
lift	VB
all
controls
on
textile
imports
...

He
lifted	VBD
the
ban
on
the
Peoples
Party
.

A
great
burden
seems
to
have
been
lifted	VBN
off
me
...

...
an
age
in
which
so
much
responsibility
is
lifted	VBN
from
individual
shoulders
and
transferred
to
the
state
.

Their
task
was
not
easy
:
to
lift	VB
a
whole
people
weighed
down
by
a
past
of
slavery
and
oppression
.

These
delightful
children
lifted	VBD
my
spirits
with
their
laughter
...

Such
a
meal
did
nothing
to
lift	VB
her
spirits
...

He
will
be
here
in
a
few
days
,
Fanny
thought
,
her
heart
lifting	VBG
.

If
the
depression
does
not
lift	VB
in
a
few
days
,
come
back
and
see
me
again
...

His
moodiness
seemed
to
have
lifted	VBN
.

Uncle
Harold
had
lifted	VBN
the
mornings
receipts
...

They
break
into
steel
filing
cabinets
,
open
cupboards
,
or
lift	VB
a
briefcase
from
a
locked
car
or
office
.

Most
of
the
article
was
lifted	VBN
from
a
womans
magazine
.

They
expect
that
this
will
lift	VB
the
rate
of
inflation
back
to
13
per
cent
...

They
want
to
lift	VB
the
threshold
at
which
extra
interest
is
charged
.

The
morning
mist
is
lifting	VBG
...

Around
midday
,
the
fog
lifted	VBD
.

...
lift-off	NN
from
a
floating
launching
pad
...

We
have
lift-off	NN
.

She
loved
the
intense
light	NN
of
the
African
plains
...

...
hair
that
is
almost
black
in
certain
lights	NNS
.

Move
!
Youre
standing
in
my
light	NN
...

Stand
out
of
the
light	NN
...

He
moved
aside
to
allow
him
more
light	NN
.

At
four
oclock
the
light	NN
was
going
fast
...

We
wanted
to
get
home
during
the
light	NN
.

There
were
other
lights	NNS
in
the
sky
that
moved
fast
or
flashed
...

Up
ahead
I
see
the
lights	NNS
of
a
town
.

He
undressed
and
put
out
the
light	NN
...

She
went
into
her
daughters
room
and
turned
on
the
light	NN
...

I
turned
off
the
lights	NNS
and
got
into
bed
.

I
had
to
apply
the
brakes
rather
abruptly
at
a
red
light	NN
...

The
lights	NNS
were
against
us
all
the
way
...

Turn
left
at
the
next
set
of
lights	NNS
.

Very
few
cars
had
reversing
lights	NNS
...

The
driver
turned
off
his
lights	NNS
...

People
drove
under
the
speed
limit
,
with
their
lights	NNS
on
.

The
flames
lit	VBD
their
faces
...

The
room
was
lighted	VBN
by
a
very
small
,
dim
bulb
...

The
corridors
are
lit	VBN
only
by
artificial
light	VB
.

The
house
was
airy
and
light	JJ
inside
.

The
forms
lighted	NN

lit	VBN
are
both
used
as
the
past
tense
and
past
participle
of
the
verb
,
although
lit	VBN
is
more
usual
.

The
murderous
light	NN
never
left
his
eyes
during
those
weeks
...

I
could
see
a
questioning
and
reproachful
light	NN
in
Janes
eyes
...

From
the
light	NN
in
his
eye
she
recognized
why
his
battalion
called
him
Tiger
Hanks
.

She
stopped
and
lit	VBD
a
match
...

Lizzie
lighted	VBN
a
cigarette
...

The
fire
took
a
long
time
to

.

Have
you
got
a
light	NN
?

The
bag
was
very
light	JJ
,
as
though
there
were
nothing
in
it
...

We
need
a
light	JJ
metal
,
like
aluminium
.

The

lighted	NN

are
both

A

...

My
tomatoes
produced
only
a

She

A

Your

She

This

extremely
worried
about
it
.

After
the
rain
stops
,
the
sky
lightens	VBZ
a
little
...

Constant
exposure
to
the
sun
had
lightened	VBD
my
hair
.

By
doing
this
you
are
lightening	VBG
the
load
of
hospital
doctors
.

Almost
immediately
they
began
to
lighten	VB
their

in
an
effort
to
increase
sales
.

Can
I

Ive

I

He
was
in
a
light-hearted	JJ
mood
.

Let
me
finish
with
a
slightly
more
light-hearted	JJ
question
...

...
a
light-hearted	JJ
remark
.

She
walked
down

quay
towards
the
lighthouse	NN
.

...

grey
lightweight	JJ

He
had
fought
some
good
lightweights	NNS
in
the
late
twenties
and
thirties
.

Most
of
them
have
been
political
lightweights	NNS
.

...
one
of
those
ever-youthful
lightweight	JJ
intellectuals
.

Last
Tuesday
week

several
light-years	NNS
away
already
...

Neither

You

In
a
game
like	IN
ours
,
one
begins
to
trust

Theres
no
point
in
stirring
up
a
lot
of
publicity
about
a
foolish
thing
like	IN
this
.

We
must
strive
for
greater
uniformity
so
that
like	JJ
offenders
should
be
treated
in
similar
fashion
.

During

She
said
they

try

get
at
the

lodged	VBN

She
allowed
her

I
consigned
the
wretched
thing
to
the
loft	NN
,
where
it
languished
,
gathering
dust
,
for
many
years

I
sat
with
him
in
the

We
explored

a

a

lofty	JJ
concept

Such
lofty	JJ
goals
were
held
to
justify
any
means

She
hated
his
lofty	JJ
manner
.

...
the
lofty	JJ
style
of
its
editorials

He
threw
another
log	NN
on
the
fire

the

Lincoln

born

Multiplication

achieved

It
is
difficult
to
believe
,
and
yet
the
logic	NN
of
the
deduction
is
undeniable
...

Their
arguments
for
atheism
do
not
have
much
logic	NN
or
cogency
.

Even
the
wilder
excesses
of
Masculine
Logic	NN
can
hardly
explain
it

It
was
futile
to
try

the

logic	NN

Economic
logic	NN
dictated
the

The

had
industrial
logic	NN

I
made
little
attempt

logical	JJ
argument

This
is
a
masterly
,
logical	JJ
analysis

Wouldnt
it
have
been
more
logical	JJ
for
them
to
make
the

downstairs?

It
seemed
a
logical	JJ
idea
to
everyone

my
mother
.

...
the
tiresome
logistics	NNS
of
modern

Logistics	NNS

remained
a

I
used
to
shudder
at
the

Not
long	RB

It
was
at
this
point

long	RB
before
their
marriage

that
he
began

feel
doubtful

The

They
took
him

It
was
awful
waiting

That

Johns
answer

this
was
to
tear

The

There

It
remained
to
be

whether

to
have
looted	VBN
it
from
the
Vatican
.

He
borrowed
it
a
fortnight
ago
to
lop	VB
his
plum
tree
.

The
keeper
came
loping	VBG
softly
up
the
lane
...

The
dog
started
to
lope	VB
alongside
my
car
.

She
settled
into
the
easy
deceptive
lope	NN
of
the
experienced
athlete
.

Gradually
a
lopsided	JJ
smile
settled
on
her
face
.

He
is
an
easy
,
loquacious	JJ
man
...

They
soon
formed
a
loquacious	JJ
group
around
the
car
.

Serfs
would
provide
their
lord	NN
with
labour
and
produce
,
and
in
exchange
he
would
protect
them
.

If
your
Lordship	NN
will
give
me
time
I
will
produce
the
evidence.
...

Im
sorry
,
sir
,
his
Lordship	NN
is
in
his
bath
...

Their
Lordships	NNS
were
already
late
for
dinner
.

Lady
Montague
looked
through
her
lorgnette	NN
at
him
.

...
a
heavy
lorry	NN
...

Hed
run
across
the
road
and
the
lorry	NN
couldnt
possibly
stop
.

...
the
people
who
lost	VBD
their
homes
in
the
earthquake
...

I
might
even
lose	VB
my
job
...

If
we
did
,
we
would
lose	VB
our
seat
at
the
conference
table
.

...
carpets
so
thick
you
could
lose	VB
a
cat
in
them
.

He
lost	VBD
the
use
of
his
legs
after
the
illness
...

...
so
shocked
that
she
lost	VBD
her
powers
of
speech
...

Then
he
would
lose	VB
his
voice
and
be
unable
to
work
...

He
kept
losing	VBG
his
balance
and
grabbing
for
the
handrail
.

He
had
lost	VBN
a
finger
and
part
of
a
thumb
in
a
fight
.

I
lost	VBD
my
father
when
I
was
nine
...

He
had
just
lost	VBN
his
wife
.

Crew
and
cargo
were
lost	VBN
in
the
storm
...

...
a
complete
list
of
all
the
goods
lost	VBN
in
the
fire
.

He
will
lose	VB
his
chances
of
promotion
...

...
you
lose	VBP
some
of
the
major
advantage
...

Bill
lost	VBD
no
time
in
telling
everyone
about
his
idea
.

At
one
time
the
company
was
losing	VBG
a
million
pounds
a
week
...

State-owned
industries
are
losing	VBG
millions
of
dollars
.

My
watch
loses	VBZ
about
five
minutes
a
day
.

They
expected
to
lose	VB
the
election
...

They
have
lost	VBN
six
games
and
won
ten
...

Nobody
expected
her
to
lose	VB
.

That
mistake
lost	VBD
us
the
game
.

I
couldnt
help
losing	VBG
my
way
in
the
maze
of
their
well-meaning
instructions
.

Both
men
were
again
lost	VBN
in
reading
...

He
lost	VBD
himself
in
a
maze
of
thoughts
...

She
sat
with
her
camera
in
her
lap
,
lost	VBN
in
concentration
.

Im
afraid
his
humour
is
just
lost	VBN
on
me
.

I
am
lost	VBN
without
him
.

After
one
match
,
the
loser	NN
actually
sent
him
a
present
...

...
the
winners

losers	NNS
in
the
development

.

Youre
a
loser	NN
,
Bill
...

You
told
me
about
the

you
were
going
to
publisha
real
loser	NN
,
it
sounded
like
.

She
will
probably
conclude
that
she
will
be
the
loser	NN
if
she
fails
to
respond
to
your
friendly
overtures
.

...
heat

from
the

Some
patients
worry
unnecessarily
about
the
initial
weight
loss	NN
...

Death
usually
results
from
loss	NN
of
fluids
.

The
aircraft
was
blown
up
with
total
loss	NN
of
life
...

The
loss	NN
of
life
was
appalling
...

Allied
artillery
fire
caused
heavy
losses	NNS
.

In
the
past
the
loss	NN
of
a
baby
was
almost
commonplace
...

That
does
not
make
up
for
the
loss	NN
of
my
daughter
and
husband
.

Hell
be
no
great
loss	NN
when
he
goes
...

You
must
consider
it
rather
a
gain
than
a
loss	NN
.

...
profit
and
loss	NN
...

The
company
announced
a
huge
loss	NN
for
the
first
half
of
the
year
...

...
their
record
$242
million
loss	NN
for
1980
and
the
first
quarter
of
1981
...

The
companys
losses	NNS
have
worsened
to
$6.1
million
.

There
was
that
time
when
we
got
lost	VBN
out
in
Dennington
...

I
think

lost	VBN
...

That
little
boy
looks
lost	VBN
.

...
strolling
down
Eighth
Avenue
,
lost	VBN
in
crowds
of
New
Yorkers
.

I
have
no
proof
because
the
laundry
list
is
in
the
lost	VBN
box
.

Dietary
needs
get
lost	VBN
in
the
savage
demands
of
our
inflationary
economy
.

They
need
to
win
back
their
lost	JJ
supporters
.

By
nine
p.m.
some
would
be
in
tears
over
lost	JJ
opportunities
...

Time
which
had
now
been
lost	VBN
for
twelve
years
had
to
be
regained
somehow
.

The
lesson
was
lost	VBN
on
the
committee
,
who
re-elected
him
for
a
further
year
in
office
.

Wilks
bet
his

Shes

the
whole

They
were
a
rather
arrogant
boring

Was

Will
you
shut
up

Most

The

She
wore

had
a
loud	JJ
voice
...

Dont
you
think
the

...
the
loudest	JJS

longest
standing
ovation
I
have
ever
heard
...

The
special
effects
get
louder	JJR

.

Northcliffes
newspapers

white-faced

The

tried
to
reassure
the

She
went
and
sat
in
the
lounge	NN
.

The
passengers
filed
into
the
arrivals
lounge	NN
.

It
pained
him
to
see
Thomas
lounging	VBG
like
that
against
the
wall
...

She
lounged	VBD
on
the
rug
.

Worse
even
than
the
lice	NN
and
rats
was
the
pain
in
his
shoulder

He
wouldnt
even
listen

What
a
louse	NN

The

A

It
was
in
my
apartment
that
you
met
the
great
love	NN
of

His
first
love	NN
was
painting

later
turned

I
would

I
shared

They
spent
a
few
days
at
Coker
,
a
lovely	JJ
Elizabethan
house
in
Somerset
...

Doesnt
she
look
lovely	JJ
,
Albert

she
whispered
...

The
setting
couldnt
have
been
lovelier	JJR
...

To
me
Hong
Kong
had
always
been
one
of
the
loveliest	JJS
places
in
the
world
.

I
had
guessed
the
identity
of
her
lover	NN
...

He
went
to
Tewkesbury
to
see
one
of
his
sons
lovers	NNS
...

I
admitted
that
Jenny
and
I
were
lovers	NNS
.

She
was
talking
to
me
like
a
lover	NN
...

...
young
lovers	NNS
.

They
began
to
feel
more
and
more
loving	JJ
to
each
other
...

...
a
loving	JJ
,
beautiful
wife
.

She
saw
the
long
scar
low	JJ
on
his
spine
...

He
pushed
his
glasses
lower	JJR
on
his
nose
and
looked
at
the
men
over
them
.

The
low	JJ
sun
cast
long
shadows
from
the
trees
...

The
afternoon
sun
was
low	JJ
above
the
gorse
bushes
.

When
their
batteries
were
low	JJ
a
switch
would
turn
them
off
.

They
have
a
very
low	JJ
opinion
of
us
.

A
whistle
came
from
Janie
,
long
and
low	JJ
...

...
a
long
low	JJ
note
on
the
cor
anglais
...

He
had
a
voice
in
the
low	JJ
tenor
range
.

Smithy
spoke
to
him
in
a
low	JJ
and
urgent
voice
...

There
was
a
low	JJ
murmur
of
conversation
in
the
hall
...

He
turned
the
radio
on
low	JJ
,
hoping
it
would
send
him
to
sleep
.

The
lights
in
the
entrance
hall
were
low	JJ
.

Your
work
is
slipping
because
you
are
feeling
so
low	JJ
...

Finding
her
in
low	JJ
spirits
,
they
had
persuaded
her
to
join
them
for
lunch
...

He
had
recovered
from
his
very
low	JJ
state
of
the
previous
evening
.

They
are
dying
to
get
the
low-down	NN
on
whats
going
on
in
Birmingham
.

He
lowered	VBD
his
glass
as
I
sat
down
beside
him
...

He
put
his
arm
round
her
and
lowered	VBD
her
on
to
the
chair
...

Lynn
ran
a
bath
and
lowered	VBD
herself
into
the
water
.

The
frozen
water
in
the
ice
caps
caused
a
lowering	NN
of
the
sea
level
.

We
have
changed
several
courses
without
any
lowering	VBG
of
examination
standards
.

I
wouldnt
lower	VB
myself
by
answering
such
a
question
.

She
lowered	VBD
her
eyes
and
remained
silent
for
a
moment
...

The
girl
shot
a
look
at
Judy
from
under
her
lowered	VBN
lids
.

She
lowered	VBD
her
voice
and
leaned
forward
.

The
organization
lent
us
support

its
own
low-key	JJ
way

...
quarrels
so
low-keyed
as
to
be
almost
invisible
.

A
number
of
trades
,
previously
thought
of
as
lowly	JJ
ones
,
began
to
receive
more
attention
...

The
magazine
ranked
a
lowly	JJ
52nd
among
British
publications
.

Certain
low-minded	JJ
individuals
would
laugh
every
time
sex
was
even
mentioned
.

The
low-paid	NNS
is
used
to
refer
to
people
who
are
low-paid	NNS

Most

What
this

I
think
we
need

have
a
man-to-man	JJ
discussion

some

Britain
would
buy
less
manufactured	VBD|VBN

more
raw

We
need

became
fascinated

Now
look

There

I
thought

The

The

No

Dont
muddle	VB
her

I
have

He

dismissed

The

The

A

They
would
lurk

Mugging	NN
in
the

even
in

was
not
uncommon

There
has
been
a
great
increase

It
was
fixed

the
wall

a
crooners
mug	NN

the
lashes

a

Keep

He
was
no

took
the
proffered

I
was
stepping
out

Hes

Many

There
have
been
several
multiple	JJ
collisions

We

The

He
declared

I
think
its
well
nigh	RB
impossible

negligence

He
went
out
late
at
night	NN
when

empty

The
night	NN
was
very
still

The

13th

He
woke
in

with
a
dreadful
pain

I
cannot

was
watching

My

He
rushed
to

she
had
nightmares	NNS

comforted
her

In
his
nightmares	NNS
they
burned

The

day
was
a
nightmare	NN
,

it
was
far
from

disaster

...
or
they
would
all

nightmare	NN
place

I
had
these
endless
nightmarish	JJ
visions

go

Our

In

Ill

Note	VB

His
audience
,
I
noted	VBD
with
regret
,
were
beginning
to
look
bored

It
is
important
for
us
to
note	VB
three
basic
facts
.

The
sale
is
noted	VBN
in
the
gunsmiths
log-book
...

Often
,
he
noted	VBD
the
exact
time

place
on
the
sketch
.

Wages
have
,
as
already
noted	VBD
,
a
dual
function
in
the
economy
...

A
government
report
released
last
week
noted	VBD
an
alarming
rise
in
racial
harassment
.

The
slow
music
rang
out
,
note	NN
by
solemn
note	NN
.

Not
one
of
them
could
read
a

the

The
boars

changed

squeal

There
was
a
note	NN
of
triumph
in
her
voice
...

His
voice
took
on
a
new
note	NN
of
uncertainty
.

I
would
,
on
a
slightly
more
serious
note	NN
,
caution
the
Party
against
over-confidence

Sensing
this
would
be
a
good
note	NN
on
which
to
end
the
interview
,
I
got
up..
This
will
strike
the
correct
note	NN

a

It
was
noteworthy	JJ
that
the
Count
was
the
only
person
who
did
not
seem
to
care.
...

One
noteworthy	JJ
fact
is
that
members
of
the
staff
seldom
complain
.

All
that
was
nothing	JJ
,
absolutely
nothing	JJ
,
to
the
joy
that
I
felt
when
I
saw
her

I
hate

Youre
disgusting

Youre
nothing	JJ

This

Hes
nothing	JJ

He
achieved
some
public
notice	NN
in

Nevertheless
,
they
deserve
notice	NN

respect

At

there
was
a
large
notice	NN
which
said
Visitors

Someone
put
up
a

about
it

Shortly
after

they
ceased

One

still

The

It
did
not
have
any
noticeable	JJ
effect

It
was
noticeable	JJ

The

seemed
to
be

You
will
normally
be
sent
an

The

The

A

Blake
some
time

find
his
place

national
artists

She
enacted
a
pantomime	NN

strangling

I
read
about

When
you

The

He
now
spends
weekends
skydiving

He
had

being
parachuted	VBN

blowing
up

When

The
army
paraded	VBD

The
captured
criminals
were
paraded	VBN
in
chains

streets

Young

paraded	VBD
up

down

He
paraded	VBD

He
paraded	VBD
his

She
seldom

never
paraded	VBD

Rhoda
was
parading	VBG
such
an
air

tender
dedication
that
he
felt
uneasy
.

But
this
parade	NN

force
was
only
for
show

...
the
dockers
parade	NN
of
support

These

This
episode
may
serve
as
a
paradigm	NN

The
King
retired
to
this
mountain

escape

a
choice

a

transformed
either
into
a
paradise	NN

into

This
stage
of
the

was
very
trying
indeed
;
but
it
was
paradise	NN

with
the
third

final
phase

It
was
a
technological
paradise	NN
.

It
was
busy
and
crowded

yet
at
the
same
time
peaceful
.
This
was
a
paradox	NN
she
discovered
over

over
again

This
is
perhaps
the
central
paradox	NN
of
British
politics
.

The
audience
took
this
for
a
joke
or
a
paradox	NN
...

The
answer
to
the
question
is
full
of
paradox	NN
.

It
was
paradoxical	JJ
that
,
in
a
country
where
free
speech
was
enshrined
in
the
constitution
,
people
were
persecuted
for
their
views

The
need

conquer

We

no
paragons	NNS

Compared

was

We
expect

She
refused

mind
linger

He

He
turned
his

Past	IN

The

The

When
the
kids
were
younger
,
they
nearly
drove
me
silly
,
but
theyre
past	IN
all
that
now
.

They
were
cutting
and
pasting	VBG
long
paper
chains
.

Labels
with
dates
and
the
names
of
newspapers

The

kept
busy

The

The

gave

We
have
no
pastor	NN
at
present
:
the
church
is
run
by
five
deacons
.

...
the
ordinary
pastoral	JJ
life
of
people
...

They
began
to
be
dependent
on
an
entirely
pastoral	JJ
economy
.

...
pastries	NNS
filled
with
custard
or
whipped
cream
.

The
famine
is
so
severe
that
there
is
no
pasture	NN
for
our
flocks
.

They
looked
pasty	JJ
and
red-eyed
.

He
patted	VBD
the
tree
trunk
softly
...

Dr
Hochstadt
leaned
forward
and
patted	VBD
Ettas
hand

...
a
friendly
pat	NN
on
the
shoulder
.

I
unfailingly
gave
my
pat	JJ
reply

They
come
up
with
a
nice
,
pat	JJ
generalisation
.

All
of
them
had
patches	NNS
on
their
clothes
...

I
mended
holes
in
the
sheets
by
sewing
on
square
patches	NNS
.

She
earned
money
by
patching	VBG

selling
old
clothes

They
patched	VBN

leaking
roofs

the
damp
patch	NN
at
the
corner

the
ceiling

patches	NNS

snow
...

He
had
fat
hairy
arms
,
and
a
bald
patch	NN
on
his
head
.

There
are
some
wonderful
patches	NNS
in
this
poem

...
the
difficult
patches	NNS
in
their
relationship
.

Theres
been
no
trouble
on
my
patch	NN
for
weeks
.

...
this
marvellous
patchwork	NN
of
meadows
and
marsh
.

If
you
dye
the
clothes
in
too
small
a
pan
,
the
colour
will
be
patchy	JJ
...

...
patchy	JJ

.

The
evidence
is
a
bit
patchy	JJ
,
isnt
it?
...

He
has
a
rather
patchy	JJ
grasp
of
history
.

He
mopped
the
sweat
from
his
bald
pate	NN
.

The
first
English
patent	NN
for
a
typewriter
was
issued
in
1714
...

To
protect
his
precious
device
he
even
took
out
a
patent	NN
on
it
.

...
a
packet
of
a
patent	NN
cement
mix
.

In
the
early
1870s
he
patented	VBD
a
new
kind
of
sugar
.

It
was
a
patent	JJ
impossibility
.

...
black
trousers
,
black
patent	NN
shoes
and
white
gloves
...

...
a
pair
of
black
patent	NN
leather
shoes
.

He
was
a
natural
paterfamilias	NN
.

The
path	NN
was
easy
to
follow
,
then
it
just
stopped
...

He
took
her
off
up
one
of
the
long
grassy
paths	NNS
far
away
from
us
.

On
arrival
he
found
his
path	NN
barred
...

It
moves
forward
killing
anything
in
its
path	NN
.

The
bullet
had
scored
its
path	NN
across
the
skin
of
the
fruit
...

The
flight
path	NN
of
the
747
carried
it
directly
overhead
...

...
far
beyond
the
path	NN
of
Saturn
.

I
criticized
the
path	NN
the
government
was
taking
...

...
the
broad
path	NN
of
success
...

He
saw
public
ownership
as
only
one
of
many
paths	NNS
to
achieving
a
socialist
society
.

It
was
pathetic	JJ
to
see
a
man
to
whom
reading
meant
so
much
become
almost
totally
blind
...

The
kitten
was
so
tiny
and
sweet
and
pathetic	JJ
.

Our
efforts
so
far
have
been
really
rather
pathetic	JJ
...

It
was
all
just
a
stupid
pathetic	JJ
joke
.

...
a
pathological	JJ
liar
...

He
has
a
pathological	JJ
urge
to
succeed
.

Marsha
could
make
out
a
possible
pathway	NN
through
the
wire
...

They
walked
along
the
pathway	NN
toward
the
house
.

We
have
to
decide
which
alternative
pathways	NNS
to
choose
,
which
cultural
styles
to
pursue
...

Complete
passivity
of
mind
and
body
were
the
pathway	NN
to
pleasure
.

It
took
a
vast
amount
of
patience	NN
not
to
shout
at
him
...

Ive
lost
all
patience	NN
with
you

excuses

Paul

waiting
his

Its

you
only
have
the
patience	NN

We
may
not
have
the
time

the
patience	NN

give
much
thought

his
thin

bony
legs

his
pitiful	JJ
arms

a
pitiful	JJ
sound

a
human
being
in
unbearable
pain
.

his
office
face
,
cool
and
pitiless	JJ

replacing
his
former
cordiality

The
creature
looked
at
me
with
pitiless	JJ
eyes

The
sky
was
cold
,
pale
blue
and
pitiless	JJ

Women
often
prefer
to
look
after
their
children
well
,
rather
than
working
for
a
pittance	NN
...

She
has
several
sidelines
,
none
of
which
pay
more
than
a
pittance	NN
.

She
felt
pity	NN
,
of
course
,
for
the
child
...

She
walked
away
in
an
agony
of
hopeless
grief
and
pity	NN
.

In
that
society
,
of
course
,
cripples
were
to
be
pitied	VBN

shunned

He
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
,
pitying	VBG
himself
for
what
had
been
done
to
him
.

It
seemed
a
pity	NN
to
eat
it
after
all
the
trouble
theyd
taken
in
making
it
...

It
will
be
a
terrible
pity	NN
if
this
should
happen
...

Pity	NN
you
missed
that
film
last

Angelica
gave
me

We
watched
the
compass
needle
as
it
swung
resolutely
round
on
its
pivot	NN
...

There
are
some
moments
in
life
that
are
like
pivots	NNS
around
which
your
existence
turns
.

The
great
chamber
was
the
ceremonial
pivot	NN
of
the
house
...

Their
daughter
was
the
pivot	NN
of
their
lives
...

My
days
revolved
around
two
pivots	NNS
,
my
home
and
my
studio
.

This
scene
is
probably
the
pivotal	JJ
point
of
the
whole
book
...

1941
was
the
pivotal	JJ
year
of
the
war
.

The
polls
showed
that
the
candidate
was
thought
to
have
no
charisma
,
no
pizzazz	NN
,
no
passion
.

Students
paraded
round
the
campus
carrying
placards	NNS

He
held
a
placard	NN
saying
Disarm
Now

Nobody
would
tell
her
the
truth
:
they
were
all
too
anxious
to
placate	VB
and
to
soothe
...

...
the
desire
of
politicians
to
placate	VB
the
public
.

The
Presidents
speech
seemed
astonishingly
placatory	JJ

They
were
making
placatory	JJ
gestures
.

Steelhead

Shakespeares
birthplace

Of
course
it
was
no
place	NN
to
raise
a
child
with
damaged
lungs
...

The
saloon
,
I
decided
,
was
the
place	NN
for
me
.

She
put
the
book
back
in
its
place	NN
on
the
shelf

Mrs
Kaul
had
to
leave
her
place	NN
and
go
to
the
back

the

to
reprimand
the
boys

Dont
park
your

I
keep

She
twisted
around

show
the

on
her
back

Fires
were
still
burning
in
many
places	NNS
.

They
decided
to
relegate
the
massed
frontal
attack
to
second
place	NN
and
to
concentrate
on
a
small-scale
offensive
...

Adults
in
the
commune
took
second
place	NN
to
the
children
.

He
talked
about
how
well
were
placed	VBN
with
regard
to
America
and
Japan
...

As
for
finance
,
were
better
placed	VBN
than
people
think
...

Such
an
organization
could
help
and
encourage
those
similarly
placed	VBN
today
.

This
salary
should
be
placed	VBN
against
an
average
of
9,000
in
the
rest
of
the
profession
...

She
is
placed	VBN
amongst
the
leading
poets

her
generation
.

She
took
first
place	NN
in
the
Highlands

Fair

Thus
the
US
leapt
from

second

the
league

Her
finger
was
pressed

He
pretended
to
have
lost
his
place	NN
in
his
notes

The
agreement
was
thus
not
placed	VBN

Chamberlain
placed	VBD

His

Two

havent
been

The
New
Left
placed	VBD
much
emphasis

the
role

The
government
had
placed	VBN
reliance

Vita

.

Dad
placed	VBD
the

We
placed	VBD

She
walked

For

His

Londons
fogs

The

Even
experienced

I
dont

Your

looked

Behind

was
a

She

Judy
passed
from

Suddenly
a
plate	NN
on
the
side

the
boiler
cracked

steam
roared
out

We
got
into
the
cellar
through
a
round
hole
covered

a
metal
plate	NN

I
read
her
name

polished
brass

There
were
two

The

They
have
heavy
scales
attached

bony

have

In

have
reached

The
speaker
mounted
the
platform	NN
...

Chopins
performances
on
the
platform	NN
were
always
brilliant
.

It
provides
a
platform	NN
for
the
consumers
viewpoint

He
used
this
personal
battle
as
a
platform	NN
from
which
to
campaign
for
reform
.

He
campaigned

jumped
off

the
bus
was
still
moving

Given
his
liking

platitudes	NNS

he
might
well
have
added

fashion

sex
entered
the

Her
interest
in

was
entirely
platonic	JJ

We
had

The

The

He
made
most

I
presumed
someone
was
playing	VBG
a
rather
sick
joke

They
played	VBD
a
dirty
trick
on

Out

He
revolutionized

The
glossy

I

It

The

The

She

You

What

A

My

was
prompted	VBN
by
a
number

The

prompted	VBD
him

call

We
listened
so
attentively
that
the
Doctor
felt
prompted	VBN

expand

theme

It
was
Annes
nagging
which
prompted	VBD
me
into
this
visit

doctor
.

She
needed

three

I
had

be
given

Morris
prompted	VBD

The

Mary

The

When

English

often

Both

My

If

His

The

It

They

this
shock

Her
death
was
a
great
grief
to
him

I
doubt
if
he
ever
recovered	VBD
afterwards

It
would
mean

The
doctor
advised
him
to
stay

he
was

.

The
shock

the
operation
delayed

recovery	NN
...

He
made
a
good
recovery	NN
from
his
stroke

His
advisers
insisted

no
economic
recovery	NN

An
anonymous
phone-call
led

the
recovery	NN

The

sufficient

bring
about
the
recovery	NN

equanimity

that

I

His

It

It

A

We
reeled	VBD

My

His

dazed

continually

I
used

refine	VB

The

to
be
refined	VBN

They
had
a

This
impermanence

reflected	VBN
in

many
subtle
ways

There

more

I
have
of

had
a

reflected	VBD
badly
on

worse
on

Their
behaviour
in

a

it
an

this
issue
is
a
very
sad
reflection	NN
on

thought
this
a
very
fair

way

lived

Its
easy

This

She

Some

his
release	NN
he
was
still
unable
to
sleep
properly
.

I
was
released	VBN
,
for
the
first
time
,
from
all
my
guilty
thoughts
...

This
releases	VBZ
them
from
personal
responsibility
.

He
was
released	VBN
to
complete
the
funeral
arrangements
for
his
sons
.

The
release	NN
of
staff
for
training
purposes
is
actively
encouraged
.

We
felt
it
was
time
the
President
released	VBD
the
Watergate
tapes
...

I
was
waiting
for
the
office
to
tell
me
to
release	VB
the
keys
...

Their
aim
was
to
release	VB
money
for
the
schools
...

The
statement
had
to
be
delivered
to
someone
who
could
release	VB
it
to
the
press
.

His
relatives
finally
agreed
to
the
release	NN
of
his
private
papers
...

The
Government
announced
a
month
later
the
release	NN
of
one
million
pounds
.

We
considered
issuing
some
sort
of
statement
or
press
release	NN
.

He
quickly
released	VBD
her
hand
.

The
bomb
load
was
automatically
released	VBN
by
the
computer
.

The
reported
release	NN
of
a
missile
over
the
Indian
Ocean
...

He
pressed
the
release	NN
button
.

He
made
sure
the
brake
had
been
fully
released	VBN
...

I
ran
to
the
door
and
released	VBD
the
catch
.

Paramount
Pictures
planned
to
release	VB
the
film
before
Christmas
.

The
London
release	NN
of
The
Janitor
begins
on
Saturday
.

Their
new
single
has
just
been
released	VBN
.

Their
new
release	NN
is
called
Tattoo
You
.

...
a
great
release	NN
of
explosive
energy
...

...
the
controlled
release	NN
of
water
from
reservoirs
.

This
can
help
us
to
release	VB
our
latent
anger
.

...
a
great
release	NN
of
joy
...

...
the
harmless
release	NN
of
rebellious
spirits
.

Much
of
the
existing
text
can
safely
be
relegated	VBN
to
the
footnotes
...

This
kind
of
approach
may
relegate	VB
these
problems
somewhere
down
on
the
priority
list
.

Theyve
lost
three
matches
in
a
row
,
but
at
least
they
are
not
likely
to
be
relegated	VBN
.

In
certain
circumstances
,
our
parents
would
relent	VBP
and
permit
us
to
meet
.

...
the
relentless	JJ
beating
of
the
sun
on
the
roofs
...

The
traffic
noise
is
relentless	JJ
...

...
the
relentless	JJ
population
increase
.

He
could
be
a
relentless	JJ
enemy
.

This
point
is
not
really
relevant	JJ
and
we
had
better
move
on
...

...
highly
relevant	JJ
information
...

He
could
use
all
the
material
that
was
relevant	JJ
.

They
accept
that
what
you
are
doing
is
relevant	JJ
to
their
problems
...

The
North
American
experience
may
be
highly
relevant	JJ
for
the
emergent
countries
...

Chinas
experience
seemed
more
relevant	JJ
in
their
situation
than
that
of
the
USSR
.

We
have
no
reliable	JJ
information
about
that
.

The
telegram
was
based
on
information
from
a
reliable	RB
source

They
are
often
reliant	JJ
on
government
funds
.

...
relics	NNS
of
her
distant
past
...

These
ideas
are
relics	NNS
of
Victorian
discipline
.

We
visited
a
museum
with
relics	NNS
of
great
explorers
.

You
can
still
see
the
last
surviving
relic	NN
of
the
old
Palace
of
Westminster
...

We
often
dug
up
relics	NNS
of
the
Civil
War
in
our
playground
.

The
relief	NN
of
Khe
Sanh
began
on
April
1
.

When
does
your
relief	NN
come
on
duty?
...

They
had
to
phone
for
a
relief	NN
driver
.

Anxiety
may
be
relieved	VBN
by
talking
to
a
friend
...

The
passengers
swallow
to
relieve	VB
the
pressure
on
their
eardrums
.

The
news
relieved	VBD
him
of
some
of
his
embarrassment
...

By
writing
down
all
your
familys
birthdays
you
relieve	VB
yourself
of
the
burden
of
remembering
them
.

He
relieved	VBD
her
of
the
plates
she
was
holding
...

Let
me
relieve	VB
you

They
sent
an

He
returned
to
his
room
before
relieving	VBG
the
porter
in
the
afternoon
.

He
went
into
the
house
to
relieve	VB
himself
.

...
the
Christian
religion	NN
...

Her
religion	NN
is
severe
and
uncompromising
.

Virtually
all
religious	JJ
activities
were
suppressed

...
people
who
have
no
religious	JJ
faith
...

She
could
not
accept
the
religious	JJ
beliefs
of
her
parents
.

The
young
woman
was
gentle
and
religious	JJ
...

Our
parents
were
very
religious	JJ
and
very
patriotic
.

The
ornaments
were
all
religiously	RB
dusted
by
Gertrude

England

been
forced

relinquish	VB
her
Empire

She
relinquished	VBD
the
editorship
of
the
newspaper
...

Step
by
step
she
has
relinquished	VBN
all
responsibility

The
truth
is
that
he
relishes	VBZ
the
challenge
of
competition
...

Hendricks
smiled
,
relishing	VBG
his
moment
of
command
.

In
his
book
he
exposed
with
relish	NN
all
the
evils
of
our
present
day
...

The
sight
of
the
dead
bird
ended
my
relish	NN
for
shooting
at
anything
live
.

I
had
a
curious
urge
to
relive	VBP
my
visit
there
with
her
...

Its
depressing
if
you
spend
too
much
time
reliving	VBG
old
joys
.

The
captain
stopped
to
reload	VB

Our

He

Actresses

The

Hong

They
made
little
use

relied	VBN
upon

Mrs
Oliver
remained	VBD
silent

Her
husband
remained	VBD
standing
...

The
results
of
these
experiments
remain	VBP
a
secret
.

I
was
allowed
to
remain	VB
at

Otto
was
having
the
greatest
difficulty
in
remaining	VBG
in
his
seat
.

Even
today
remnants

this
practice
remain	VBP
...

He
was
cut
off
from
what
remained	VBD
of
his
family
.

Much
still
remains	VBZ
to
be
done
...

One
hazard
remained	VBD
to
be
overcome
.

These
problems
remain	VBP
...

Many
questions
remain	VBP
about
the
mechanics
of
Jupiters
atmosphere
...

The
fact
remains	VBZ
that
they
mean
to
destroy
us
.

She
tore
off
the
remains	NNS
of
the
paper
label
...

They
drove
past
the
remains	NNS
of
two
bombed-out
tanks
...

The
remains	NNS
of
the
meat
sat
on
the
kitchen
table
.

She
pleaded
for
his
remains	NNS

returned

so
that
he
could
be
given
a
proper

the

Your
grandfather
was
a
good
friend

he
remarked	VBD

As
R.L.Stevenson
remarked	VBD
,
To
travel
hopefully
is
a
better
thing
than
to
arrive.
...

Marys
friends
remarked	VBD
that
she
could
hate
as
passionately
as
she
could
love
...

If
any
of
his
friends
remarked	VBD
on
his
sudden
failure
to
appear
I
explained
that
he
had
gone
to
visit
his
father
.

At
school
some
of
the
children
used
to
make
unkind
remarks	NNS
about
my
clothes
...

His
opening
remarks	NNS
were
serious
and
philosophical
...

He
closed
the
discussion
with
the
remark	NN
that
the
economy
is
showing
signs
of
improving
.

He
prepared
the
dinner
with
remarkable	JJ
speed
and
efficiency
...

His
statement
was
remarkable	JJ
for
its
clarity
...

She
was
altogether
a
rather
remarkable	JJ
woman
...

Her
achievement
was
the
more
remarkable	JJ
in
that
she
had
come
from
such
a
poor
family
.

...
a
drastic
remedy	NN
for
lawlessness
and
disorder
...

...
a
new
political
movement
that
saw
remedies	NNS
to
the
whole
predicament
.

He
preferred
home-made
remedies	NNS
to
even
the
most
modern
pharmaceutical
products
.

Technicians
laboriously
tried
to
find
and
remedy	VB
faults
...

Such
measures
can
do
little
to
remedy	VB
the
fundamental
wrong
.

I
wake
up
early
trying
to
remember	VB
the
things
I
have
to
do
...

Something
else
was
worrying
her
,
but
she
could
not
remember	VB
what
it
was
...

And
did
she?I
dont
know
,
I
cant
remember	VB
.

She
found
it
almost
impossible
to
remember	VB
her
lines
...

I
remember	VBP
long
pieces
of
Shakespeare
.

She
gave
me
a
list
of
things
to
remember	VB
...

Remember	VB
to
go
to
the
post
office
.

That
,
you
must
remember	VB
,
was
before
I
was
born
...

Remember	VB
that
women
did
not
gain
the
vote
until
1918
...

It
must
be
remembered	VBN
that
many
of
them
would
be
over
retirement
age
.

The
thing
for
which
he
will
be
remembered	VBN
by
history
is
his
honesty
...

He
will
be
remembered	VBN
as
the
losing
candidate
.

On
November
11th
we
remember	VBP
the
dead
of
two
world
wars
.

My
aunt
always
remembers	VBZ
me
on
my
birthday
.

Dont
forget
to
remember	VB
me
to
your
father
.

We
have
many
pleasant
remembrances	NNS
of
my
aunt
.

I
took
the
photos
as
a
pictorial
remembrance	NN
of
the
trip
.

You
do
not
need
to
remind	VB
people
of
their
mistakes
all
the
time
...

She
had
to
remind	VB
him
that
he
had
a
wife
...

Oh
,
that
reminds	VBZ
me
,
said
John

Wheres

Remind	VB

...

Dont

to
remind	VB
her

He
reminded	VBD
himself
to
thank
Mary
for
the
present
...

Miss
Lemon
reminded	VBD
him
of
two
appointments
.

Your
son
reminds	VBZ
me
of
you
at
his
age
...

He
wasnt
quite
sure
what
it
reminded	VBD
him
of
.

Seeing
her
again
was
a
painful
reminder	NN
of
how
different
things
had
been
five
years
ago
...

Just
a
reminder	NN
that
you
can
get
those
papers
from
my
secretary
...

She
sent
him
to
bed
with
a
reminder	NN
to
hang
up
his
clothes
.

Ive
had
another
reminder	NN
from
the
library
.

Wartime
experiences
were
something
to
reminisce	VB
about
.

She
continued
with
fascinating
reminiscences	NNS
of
their
marriage
...

I
spoke
with
the
hall
porter
and
exchanged
reminiscences	NNS
about
Robertson
.

He
lapsed
into
the
silence
of
reminiscence	NN
.

He
tells
many
stories
in
his
reminiscences	NNS
Time
Was
.

The
atmosphere
was
reminiscent	JJ
of
spy
movies
...

There
was
a
sweetish
smell
,
vaguely
reminiscent	JJ
of
coffee
.

We
listened
to
Captain
Imrie
speaking
,
quietly
reminiscent	JJ
...

In
her
reminiscent	JJ
moods
she
used
to
tell
us
about
her
childhood
.

Unfortunately
,
sociologists
have
been
remiss	JJ
in
countering
such
misconceptions
.

I
promised
to
remit	VB
the
balance
,
plus
interest
,
in
monthly
instalments
...

The
travel
bureau
was
asking
me
to
remit	VB
promptly

Lord
Scarmans

Post
the
form
with
the
remittance	NN
to
the
appropriate
passport
office
.

They
still
clutched
at
the
remnants	NNS
of
their
self-esteem
...

Even
today
remnants	NNS
of
this
practice
remain
.

The
Kirks
had
remodelled	VBN
their
house
...

The
building
has
been
much
altered

He

the
manager
to
remonstrate	VB

She
remonstrated	VBD
with
the
porter
.

There
he
stood

looking
sad

remorseful	JJ

agreeing

every
word

teacher
at
school

insisting

done

...
the
frightful
,
remorseless	JJ
noise

remote	JJ

Looking

are
you

You

Clare

obviously
the

person

talk

I
dont
think
its
right	JJ

It
would
not
have
been

You
certainly
know
whether
what
you
are
doing
is
right	JJ

wrong

It
was
right	JJ

proper
that
I
should
be
present

The
engineer

been

Youre
absolutely

I
think
Im
right	JJ

the

central

We
were
right	JJ
to
insist

certain

I
think
he
was
absolutely
right	JJ

doing
this

He
doesnt
feel

Im

He
began

Politically

shes
further

He
was
there

right	VB
the

The

right	VB

the
vote

not
by
violence

a
righteous	JJ

wise

There
was
an
outburst

righteous	NN
indignation

He
denied
his
children

their
rightful	JJ
inheritance

They
had
no

She

Are
you

Henry

My

He
was
able
to
bring
back

been
dismissed

This
is
something
perfectly
forgivable

Every
right-thinking	JJ

going

agree

Child-raising

I
did
not
see	VB
his
determination
as
a
defect
...

How
do
you
see	VB
yourself
as
an
artist?
...

The
problem
,
as
I
see	VBP
it
,
is
not
advice
but
direct
help
...

As
far
as
I
can
see	VB
,
its
not
convenient
to
believe
in
an
afterlife
.

How
would
you
like
to
see	VB
education
changed?
...

It
would
be
a
tremendous
achievement
to
see	VB
man
flying
under
his
own
power
...

In
recent
times
we
have
seen	VBN
a
huge
split
develop
between
rich
and
poor
nations
.

Hed
seen	VBN
a
lot
of
action
...

She
seemed
to
think
that
shed
seen	VBN
it
all
.

She
saw	VBD
herself
seated
behind
the
cash
register
,
smiling.
...

It
is
perfectly
possible
to
see	VB
a
situation
in
which
war
would
break
out
...

Can
you
see	VB
women
going
into
combat
carrying
forty-pound
guns
?

It
has
already
been
seen	VBN
how
rocks
can
be
dated
by
the
fossils
they
contain
...

We
saw	VBD
in
the
last
chapter
some
of
the
risks
inherent
in
these
policies
...

As
we
shall
see	VB
later
,
this
is
an
attractive
idea
.

Im
taking
these
seeds	NNS
home

sunflower
seeds	NNS

All

One
rancher

Several

been
seeded	VBN
with
poplar

alder
.

The
seeds	NNS
of
doubt
had
been
sown
...

National
revolt
was
a
long
way
off
but
the
seeds	NNS
of
it
were
already
being
sown
.

He
was
seeded	VBN
number
2
.

Before
we
could
stop
him
,
he
had
trampled
the
seedbeds	NNS
.

This
household
has
been
a
seed-bed
of
ill-will
and
strife
for
five
years
...

Education
should
be
a
seedbed	NN
in
which
to
plant
real
ideas
about
life
.

I
prepared
the
earth
carefully

Im
feeling
a
bit
seedy	JJ
this

They
moved

London

Thousands

food

shelter
.

Both
the
Russians

the
Americans
are
seeking	VBG
peace

The
bombing
could
have
been
done
by
someone
seeking	VBG
revenge
...

They
are
seeking	VBG
a
10
per
cent
a
year
reduction
in
their
work
force
.

I
keep
thinking
about
it
,
seeking	VBG
a
solution
to
my
problem
...

The
answers
they
seek	VBP
are
not
forthcoming
.

I
was
seeking	VBG
the
help
of
someone
who
spoke
French
...

His
views
on
the
war
were
sought	VBN
by
the
American
press
...

My
insomnia
was
bad
enough
for
me
to
seek	VB
the
advice
of
a
psychiatrist
.

Power
stations
are
seeking	VBG
to
reduce
their
use

Teachers
are
using
the
very
teaching
methods
our
parents
had
sought	VBN
to
reject
.

Even
minor
problems
seem	VBP
important
...

It
seemed	VBD
like
a
good
idea
.

He
seemed	VBD
nice
enough
...

You
seem	VBP
to
be
very
interested
.

After
what
seemed	VBD
like
hours
he
came
out
with
a
wry
smile
...

There
dont
seem	VBP
to
be
many
people
on
campus
today
...

It
seemed	VBD
as
though
I
had
known
them
for
a
very
long
time
.

I
used
to
lie
awake
at
night
watching
the
rain
seep	VB
through
the
cracks
...

Instead
of
draining
away
,
water
seeps	VBZ
down
into
the
ground
.

Atrocity
stories
began
to
seep	VB
out
of
the
Congo
...

Reports
which
seeped	VBD
out
made
this
clear
.

He
was
considered
a

a
prophet

Ignatius
sees

I
seethed	VBD

secret
rage
one
night
...

By
now
David
was
seething	VBG
.

The
streets

London
seethed	VBD
with
a
marching

flag-waving
crowd

The
ships
seethed	VBN
with
noise

activity

a
seething	VBG
mass

maggots

A
much
larger

be
affected
...

Different
segments	NNS
of
the
panel
are
painted
different
colours
.

They
tried
to
segregate	VB
pedestrians
and
vehicles
...

Little
effort
was
made
to
segregate	VB
the
sexes
.

He
refused
to
play
before
segregated	JJ
audiences
...

None
of
the
opposing
teams
was
segregated	JJ

Clarissa

The

Seizing	VBG

The

been
seized	VBN

The

his

house
were
seized	VBN
.

He
was

went

I
always
seize	VB

opportunity

go

the
opera
.

She
was
seized	VBN
with
the
desire
to
play
jazz
piano
.

It
is
conceivable
that
he
had
a
seizure	NN
of
some
kind
and
then
drowned
...

During
the
screening

There

she
could
select	VB

The

voted

They

They

The

were
asked

be
less
selective	JJ

The
selectors	NNS
chose

leave

I
consulted
the

In

Once

Without

Single

...
Jackie
Felt
,
our
trainer

self-appointed	JJ
spiritual
guide
...

The
revolutionarys
mission
was
a
self-appointed	JJ
role
.

Regular
encouragement
can
help
make
them
more
self-assertive	JJ
and
confident
.

His
monumental
self-assurance	NN
was
based
upon
his
complete
faith
in
his
own
ability
.

He
states
everything
in
a
self-assured	JJ
way
...

Personally
,
Im
more
self-assured	JJ
now
.

He
was
much
too
self-centred	JJ
to
notice
her
...

...
an
increasingly
self-centred	JJ
society
.

He
can
only
develop
self-confidence	NN
if
he
is
told
he
is
good
and
clever
...

We
began
to
lose
our
self-confidence	NN
.

Shes
a
strong
,
self-confident	JJ
woman

Because
they
are
self-confident	JJ
,
they
are
not
so
likely
to
regard
you
as
a
threat
.

I
stood
there
,
feeling
self-conscious	JJ
.
Was
my
hair
out
of
place?
...

At
first
I
was
self-conscious	JJ
about
being
a
movie
star
.

The
proletarian
movement
is
the
self-conscious	JJ
,
independent
movement
of
the
oppressed
classes
.

The
university
campus
is
like
a
self-contained	JJ
city
with
shops
and
all
amenities
...

The
intelligentsia
often
see
themselves
as
a
self-contained	JJ
group
outside
the
class
system
.

She
has
a
self-contained	JJ
three-roomed
flat

a
garden

He
lost
his
self-control	NN
and
cried
aloud
...

Clives
calmness
and
self-control	NN
was
very
impressive
.

She
appeared
calm
and
self-controlled	JJ
in
the
face
of
the
disaster
.

It
is
self-defeating	JJ
and
ultimately
suicidal
to
ignore
the
progress
of
events
...

...
a
self-defeating	JJ
policy
.

He
called
in
to
order
a
self-drive	JJ
hire
car
for
the
following
morning
.

For
a
self-educated	JJ
writer
I
think
his
work
shows
remarkable
talent
.

People
here
are
rather
self-effacing	JJ

He
has
shown
a
self-effacing	JJ
charm
.

...
his
job
as
a
self-employed	JJ
builder
and
decorator
.

He
wanted
to
regain
his
self-esteem	NN
...

Being
right
usually
adds
to
ones
self-esteem	NN
.

The
need
for
reform
was
self-evident	JJ
...

The
answers
to
moral
problems
are
not
self-evident	JJ
.

I
do
so
admire
your
superb
gift
of
self-expression	NN
...

...
opportunities
for
political
self-expression	NN
.

He
coughed

hummed
in
a
self-important	JJ
way

troubles

were
largely
self-imposed	JJ

self-imposed	JJ

He
continued
to
be
self-indulgent	JJ
,
as
he
had
been
indulged
when
he
was
a
little
boy
.

It
is
not
enough
to
protect
animals
for
self-interested	JJ
reasons
alone

I
didnt
realize
you
were
so
selfish	JJ

The

Scandal

what

Her

Lets

Youve

I
Sellotaped	VBD
the

The

By

He
smacked	VBD

He
was
rude

I
gave

She
smacked	VBD

Any

of
the
press
was
favourable
.

We
had
to
look
through
all
her
holiday
snaps	NNS
...

...
taking
snaps	NNS
of
the
children
at
the
beach

Our
photographer

a
nice
photograph
of
him
.

The
children

When
she
was
rushed
she
became
snappish	JJ
.

Hes
such
a
snappy	JJ
dresser
.

It
was
run
by
a
peculiarly
snappy	JJ
and
short-tempered
woman
.

The
mood
of
the
show
is
spirited
,
snappy	JJ
,
and
young
.

They
are
worried
about
the
way
in
which
badgers
are
being
snared	VBN
.

They
are
creating
wealth
through
political
agencies
as
a
snare	NN
and
a
delusion
...

She
had
been
warned
of
the
snares	NNS
of
the
world
.

...
dogs
snarling	VBG
and
snapping
at
the
heels
of
sheep
.

The
lion
would
bare
his
teeth
in
a
furious
snarl	NN
.

Let
me
alone
,
I
snarled	VBN
.

Perfect
societies
have
no
snarls	NNS
and
flaws
.

He
snatched	VBD
the
letter
from
the
mans
hand
...

...
children
fighting
,
snatching	VBG
each
others
sweets
...

He
snatched	VBD
his
hands
away
...

He
remembered
snatching	VBG
at
his
gun
.

I
packed
,
then
snatched	VBN
four
hours
sleep
...

She
snatched	VBD
a
brief
time
alone
with
him
...

They
struggled
on
,
snatching	VBG
happiness
where
they
could
.

He
snatched	VBD
my
wallet
and
a
bag
.

Sometimes
I
overheard
snatches	NNS
of
their
talk
...

He
sang
a
snatch	NN
of
his
song
.

I
like
your
outfitvery
snazzy!
...

It
was
one
of
those
snazzy	JJ
adverts
.

That
night
I
sneaked	VBD
out
of
my
dormitory
and
crept
down
the
drive
...

I
didnt
notice
Bob
sneaking	VBG
up
behind
me
...

Hes
going
to
sneak	VBP
off
alone
with
Nell
.

I
tried
to
sneak	VBP
her
some
turkey
,
but
the
nurse
stopped
me
...

...
sneaking	VBG
spies
over
the
river
.

I
heard
what
that
stinking
sneak	VBP
did
.

His
book
leaves
one
with
a
sneaking	VBG
admiration
for
his
shameless
commercialism
...

I
couldnt
help
a
sneaking	VBG
regard
for
them
...

Ive
a
sneaking	VBG
feeling
shes
right
.

I
have
just
had
a
sneaky	JJ
glimpse
of
the
new
list
...

But
they
gained
a
sneaky	JJ
advantage
.

She
was
afraid
he
would
sneer	VB
at
the
idea
...

...
sneering	VBG
out
of
the
window
at
people
.

We
sneezed	VBD
a
lot
with
hay
fever
.

They
worry
about
every
sneeze	NN
and
rash
...

...
no
coughs
,
no
sneezes	NNS
.

I
snicked	VBD
my
forefinger
with
a
bread
knife
.

They
all
snickered	VBD
and
giggled
.

She
gave
a
short
snicker	NN
.

There
were
one
or
two
snide	JJ
comments
about
my
family
...

He
may
become
a
target
for
snide	JJ
innuendoes
.

Felicity
said
,
sniffing	VBG
,
Ill
be
so
lonely
without
you
.
When
will
you
see
me
again?
...

For
goodness
sake
,
stop
sniffing	VBG
.

Mary
gave
a
sniff	NN
and
said
Dont
worry
,
Im
not
going
to
cry
.

What
a
revolting
smell
,
he
said
,
sniffing	VBG
the
air
...

The
dog
sniffed	VBD
at
Marshas
bags
.

A
fox
came
along
and
gave
the
stone
a
good
sniff	NN
.

The
judge
seems
to
suggest
,
sniffed	VBD
the
professor
,
that
I
do
not
know
my
subject
.

A
lot
of
children
are
sniffing	VBG
glue
these
days
.

I
seem
to
have
been
sniffling	VBG
for
weeks
.

James
got
sniffy	JJ
at
what
Bill
had
said
.

Will
you
join
me
in
a
snifter	NN
?

What
are
you
sniggering	VBG
at
?

There
were
sniggers	NNS
from
the
children
when
the
lady
fell
over
.

He
took
out
a
cigar
and
,
after
snipping	VBG
off
the
end
,
lit
it
...

Brian
snipped	VBD
energetically
at
the
hedge
.

Linda
cut
the
cotton
with
a
satisfying
snip	NN
of
the
scissors
.

The
ring
was
a
snip	NN
at
twenty-five
pounds
.

The
unions
are
an
easy
target
to
snipe	VB
at
...

His
sniping	VBG
has
irritated
the
chairman
.

Just
then
someone
started
sniping	VBG
at
us
.

A
snipers	NNS
bullet
tore
up
a
wall
two
inches
above
his
head
.

Occasionally
children
come
out
with
absolutely
fascinating
snippets	NNS
of
information
...

On
the
bus
I
heard
this
interesting
snippet	NN
of
conversation
.

They
started
to
snivel	VB
,
and
after
that
,
to
cry
...

I
know
youre
tired
,
but

snivelling	VBG

All
I
could
hear
was
Roberts
frightened
snivels	NNS
.

Like
both
her
parents
she
was
a
snob	NN
.

He
is
a
dreadful
intellectual
snob	NN
.

Because
she
was
too
shy
and
too
snobbish	JJ
to
mix
with
her
neighbours
,
she
had
few
friends
...

She
had
a
slightly
snobbish	JJ
attitude
towards
the
theatre
.

...
a
couple
snogging	VBG
in
the
doorway
...

She
was
snogging	VBG
with
him
throughout
the
party
.

We
had
a
lovely
snog	NN
during
the
film
.

Its
good
to
be
alone
with
nobody
around
to
snoop	VB
or
make
a
fuss
...

He
might
have
been
killed
simply
for
snooping	VBG
around
.

We
caught
a
snooper	NN
outside
.

Ive
just
had
a
nice
snooze	NN

Ellens
mouth
fell

Hes

Posy

He

towards
the
gun
whose
snout	NN
had
not
quivered
a
millimetre
in
the
hand
that
held
it
.

The
entire
country
was
covered
in
snow	NN
...

Two
inches
of
snow	NN
fell
on
London
a
day
or
two
ago
.

This
snows
perfect
for
snowballs	NNS
...

...
a
snowball	NN
fight
.

Once
the
business
starts
to
snowball	VB
we
should
be
able
to
take
on
more
staff
.

Half
the
country
was
snowbound	JJ
.

...

wonderful
view

the
snow-capped	JJ
peaks
.

My

The

a
whirling
snowstorm	NN

I
went
to

him
one
snowy	JJ
day
in
London
...

...
a
ridge
between
two
high
snowy	JJ
peaks
.

She
was
always
snubbing	VBG
her
old
friends
by
pretending
not
to
see
them
.

Her
comments
were
clearly
intended
as
a
snub	NN
.

She
had
an
interesting
face
with
a
snub	JJ
nose
and
large
appealing
eyes
.

A
male
badger
came
out
of
its
den
and
snuffed	VBD
the
air
.

Angela
snuffled	VBD
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
.

We
lit
a
big
fire
which
made
us
feel
very
snug	JJ
and
safe
.

He
stirred
and
turned
over
to
snuggle	VB
close
to
her
...

She
pulled
the
quilt
over
her
and
snuggled	VBD

...

You

...

Etta

heartily

he
...

He

There

they
arguedeconomic
reasons
.

The
majority
of
them
have
the
eyes
so	RB
located
as
to
give
panoramic
vision
...

Alternatively
you
can
so	RB
colour
it
as
to
break
up
the
contours
...

The
machine
is
so	RB
designed
that
you
only
need
one
hand
to
operate
it
.

And
so	RB
for
now
,
goodnight
...

So	RB
to
the
winners

We

of

And

And

on
,
that
gradual
decaying
of
my
life
...

They
met
again
in
the
same
place
,
and
so	RB
it
had
continued
.

Just
as
one
gesture
can
have
many
different
meanings
,
so	IN
many
different
gestures

I
dont
think

You
must
realize
that
the
problems
of
the
world
may
not
be
solvable	JJ
by
human
intellects
alone
.

I
think
this
would
create
more
problems
than
it
would
solve	VB

...
the
failure
of
successive
Government
policies

solve	VB
Britains
economic
problems

They
have
low

need
the
money

stay

The

washed

The
Somalis	NNPS

no

Calderwood
led
him
into
the
sombre	JJ
oak-panelled

I
noticed
he
looked
unusually
sombre	JJ

His

was
sombre	JJ

They
awaited

Mr

took
a
more
sombre	JJ
view

Indian

I
did
not
meet
her
again
for
some	DT
years

She
was
moving
around
some	DT
distance
away

They
were
having
some	DT
difficulty
in
following
the
plot
...

He
will
take
some	DT
convincing
on
this
.

Theres
at

some	DT
chance
that
it
will
work
...

I
was
gratified
to
find
that
Id
had
some	DT
effect
...

That
is
still
true
to
some	DT
extent
.

We
found
it
lying
in
some	DT
ditch
in
the
middle
of
the
desert

Some	DT
grinning
stranger

To

I
found
his
style

lecturing
rather
soporific	JJ
.

I
was
sopping	JJ
wet
when
I
got

He
held
out
a

Who

Their
decision
seems
to
have
been
dictated

sordid	JJ

a
rather
sordid	JJ

I
hope
you
dont

my
mentioning

sordid	JJ
back

During

she
witnessed
the
most

Her

so
sore	JJ

could
not

Nobody
believed
him

this
made
him
sore	JJ

I
tried

about

He
made
a
face

sorrowed	VBD

dead

After
all
these

she
had
become
a
very
embittered

enjoying
the
pleasures

suffering
the
sorrows	NNS
that

off-putting

We

When
a

he
often
speaks
more
loudly

Sometimes
the
listener
takes
over
the
talk

becomes
the

The

got
up

Only

.

She

European

Its
a

I
went

knowledge
.

Work

Was

They

The

The

I
dont

He

Gradually
,

the
frenzied

take
over

the

fills
with
a
crescendo
of
sound

The

brilliant

.

There
were
no

the
hunting

He
gave
his

dollars
per
month
under
the
stringent	JJ
condition
that
she
would
never
enter
his

It
may
be

The

The
history
of
train
transport
has
partly
been
a
history
of
striving	VBG
for
greater
efficiency
...

The
Russians
strove	VBD
to
give
the
impression
that
they
were
going

land
on
the
moon
...

Historians
should
strive	VBP
after
objectivity
...

They
have
striven	VBN
for
freedom
to
create
a
new
social
order
.

The
rebellious
striving	VBG
to
get
free
from
the
parents
does
not
arise
with
all
children
.

She
put
out
a
hand
and
stroked	VBD
the
cat
softly
...

He
stroked	VBD
her
hair
affectionately
.

I
gave
the
kitten
a
little
stroke	NN
,
but
it
kept
on
mewing
.

She
had
a
stroke	NN
and
was
unable
to
walk
for
the
rest
of
her
life
...

The
stroke	NN
paralysed
half
his

.

She
began

bold
,
defiant
strokes	NNS

He
kicked

take
a
stroll	NN
in
the
garden
.

They
buried
writings

strong	JJ

survive
even
a
nuclear
catastrophe

Check
that
your
ladder

strong	JJ
and
firm
.

His
teachings
still
exert
a
strong	JJ
influence
...

The
compulsion
to
return
may
be
strong	JJ
...

All
these
factors
combined
add
up
to
a
strong	JJ
incentive
to
buy
more
machines
and
employ
more
people
.

There
is
strong	JJ
criticism
of
certain
particular
aspects
of
the
case
...

It
had
the
strong	JJ
support
of
the
General
Council
...

I
dont
have
any
very
strong	JJ
views
on
the
subject

Their
action
would
necessitate
strong	JJ
measures
...

They
came
to
power
in
1968
with
a
strong	JJ
anti-inflation
programme
.

There
is
a
strong	JJ
case
for
an
Act
of
Parliament
...

He
certainly
would
need
strong	JJ
arguments
before
he
would
divert
significant
funds
to
the
project
.

I
felt
suddenly
very
strong	JJ
and
serene
in
the
knowledge
of
my
own
innocence
...

He
has
the
rare
power
of
being
a
strong	JJ
personality
without
dominating
.

An
old
lady
,
a

Labour

your
strong	JJ
points

subject
.

I
always
thought
she
was
a
very
strong	JJ
candidate
...

He
surprised
everyone
by
finishing
a
strong	JJ
second
.

Next

you

stronger	JJR

Swearing
that
he
was
strong	JJ
enough
to
cook
again
,
he
sent
me
off
with
a
shopping
list
.

It
was
one
of
those
strong	JJ
,
firm
faces
which
have
a
permanent
tan
...

The
glance
was
strong	JJ
and
steady
in
its
challenge
.

His
success
was
based
on
inner
calm
,
strong	JJ
nerves
and
an
acute
memory
for
dates
...

It
was
an
unpleasant
world
and
one
that
required
a
strong	JJ
stomach
.

They
still
spoke
the
language
with
a
strong	JJ
German
accent
...

Most
of
them
have
strong	JJ
local
accents
.

Links

the
trade
unions

in
any

The

China
today
is
as
strong	JJ
a
unit
as

else
in

world
.

He
only
felt
the
cold
strong	JJ
wind

the
reeds
...

These
local
volcanic
tremors
are
usually
not
strong	JJ
.

Sterling
has
once
again
become
one
of
the
stronger	JJR

This
harmony

not
last
for
long
if
the
economy
stays
strong	JJ

It
also
has
a
very

She
made
him
a
cup
of
tea
so
strong	JJ
that
he
could
hardly
drink
it
.

The
drink
wasnt
strong	JJ
enough
for
him
and
he
added
more
whisky

She
never
drank

I

The

of
the
gas
grew
stronger	JJR
;
she
began
to
feel
giddy
...

It
had
a
bad
taste
,
strong	JJ
and
salty
.

The
light

There

In

Kingdoms

suffered	VBN
a
staggering
setback
...

We
were
warned
to
agree
with
the
government
or
suffer	VB
the
consequences
.

The
only
people
thatll
suffer	VB
are
the
vehicle
owners
...

They
would
be
the
first
to
suffer	VB
if
these
proposals
were
ever
carried
out
.

In
these
circumstances
relationships
tend
to
suffer	VB
...

Im
not
surprised
that
your
studies
are
suffering	VBG
.

This
treatment
has
proved
effective
for
slipped
disc
sufferers	NNS
...

...
sufferers	NNS
of
chronic
disease
.

...
facing
their
losses
or
sufferings	NNS
as
though
these
things
were
inevitable
.

They
made
her
have
an
operation
when
a
mere
prescription
of
rest
would
have
sufficed	VBN
...

Any
one
of
these
arguments
suffices	VBZ
to
make
my
case
.

In
1957
we
had
some
600
jet
fighters
and
a
sufficiency	NN
of
airfields
to
support
them
.

Japan
had
a
reserve
of
oil
sufficient	JJ
for
its
needs
...

If
the
matter
is
of
sufficient	JJ
importance
it
will
be
referred
to
the
directors
...

Sales
were
not
sufficient	JJ
to
make
it
a
profitable
proposition
...

It
is
sufficient	JJ
to
say
here
that
it
worked
very
well
.

If
we
had
arrived
a
minute
later
they
would
have
suffocated	VBN
...

The
smoke
and
fumes
almost
suffocated	VBN
me
.

It
was
nearly
dawn
,
and
the
room
was
already
suffused	VBN
with
light
.

Lally
poured
us
all
a
cup
of
tea
and
helped
herself
to
sugar	NN
.

Is
this
my
tea
?
Did
you
sugar	VB
it
?

Come
over
here
,
sugar	NN
,
and
let
mummy
look
at
your
new
dress
.

Most
pills
these
days
are
sugar-coated	JJ
,
so
be
careful
that
children
dont
mistake
them
for
sweets
.

She
was
not
deceived
by
his
sugar-coated	JJ
promises
.

The
proposition
was
couched
in
sugared	JJ
terms
...

She
spoke
in
sugared	JJ
tones
.

...
a
sugary	JJ
phrase
,
that
didnt
manage
to
conceal
his
dislike
of
her
...

She
gave
a
sweet
sugary	JJ
smile
that
made
my
blood
run
cold
.

We
have
to
suggest	VB
a
list
of
possible
topics
for
next
terms
seminars
...

Various
techniques
can
be
used
and
these
are
suggested	VBN
in
other
chapters
...

Might
I
suggest	VBP
that
you
offer
your
manuscript
to
Collins
?

Helen
has
suggested	VBN
Richard
as
the
next
chairman
of
the
society
...

Can
you
suggest	VB
somewhere
for
a
short
holiday
?

Im
not
suggesting	VBG
that
the
accident
was
your
fault
...

It
would
be
foolish
to
suggest	VB
that
everyone
in
Britain
is
rich
...

No
one
would
dream
of
suggesting	VBG
retirement
to
him
.

His
expression
suggested	VBD
some
pleasure
at
the
fact
that
I
had
come
...

It
is
ridiculous
to
increase
public
spending
at
a
time
when
all
the
evidence
suggests	VBZ
it
should
be
cut
.

We
used
swaying
green
curtains
to
suggest	VB
the
wood
in
the
play
.

He
was
a
strange
man
:
shy
,
eager
to
please
,
and
very
suggestible	JJ
.

I
made
a
few
suggestions	NNS
about
how
we
could
spend
the
afternoon
...

The
other
governments
greeted
the
suggestion	NN
with
caution
.

His
golf
club
recruits
mostly
on
suggestions	NNS
from
present
members
.

He
replied
to
her
question
with
the
merest
suggestion	NN
of
a
smile
...

Her
hands
had
about
them
no
suggestion	NN
of
age
.

The
girls
stood
around
,
exchanging
gossip
and
calling
out
suggestive	JJ
remarks
...

If
she
said
something
that
I
considered
suggestive	JJ
,
I
would
make
a
sharp
retort
.

His
behaviour
was
suggestive	JJ
of
a
cultured
man
.

What
should
you
do
if
you
or
your
friend
feels
suicidal?
...

Counsellors
are
used
to
dealing

suicidal	JJ
people
.

He
made
a
suicidal	JJ
attempt
to
rescue
his
wife

...
suicidal	JJ
violence
.

It
is
self-defeating
and
ultimately
suicidal	JJ
to
ignore
such
warnings
by
your
superiors
.

The
founder
of
British
India

Clive

committed
suicide	NN
in
1774

Deep
depression
is
typical
of
so
many
young
women
who
attempt
suicide	NN

There
is
a
connection
between
a
rising

rising
suicide	NN
rate
.

A
typical
suicide	NN
is
a
late
middle-aged

elderly
man
.

People
had
told
me
it
was
suicide	NN
to
admit
to
my
past
...

By
refusing
to
accept
the
decision
,
he
had
committed
professional
suicide	NN

He
always
wore
an
expensive
grey
suit	NN

dark
tie

She
wore
a
black
suit	NN

She
was

over

All
this
suits	VBZ

purpose
very

You
should
do
what
the
doctor
thinks
will
suit	VB
you

the
baby
best

That
colour
didnt
suit	VB
them
.

A
job
where
I
was
inside
all
day
wouldnt
suit	VB
me

We
discussed
the
progress
of
the
suit	NN
and
the
legal
fight
to
prevent
my
extradition
.

He
was

not

These

The

He
had

the
summit	NN

The
summit	NN
of

career
came
when
he
was
made
managing
director

He
summoned	VBD

He
was
summoned	VBN

They
had
to
summon	VB
a
second
conference

change
the

A
few
weeks

I
was
summoned	VBN

the
magistrate
.

She
could
not
summon	VB
the
strength

sit
up

I
replied
in
as
neutral

I
could
summon	VB

I
waited
in

You
parked

He
was
summonsed	VBN

You
need

fresh
air

We
all
sat
in

sun	NN
.

He
spent
Saturday
sunning	VBG
himself
on
the
beach

I
spent
my
afternoons
sunbathing	VBG
instead

doing

work

I
had
a
day
off
to
do
some
sunbathing	NN
.

The
park

full

sunbathers	NNS

put

We
passed
through

plots

To
stop
squinting
I
put
on

disposition

The
figure
turned

sunrise	NN

You
must
really
see
some
beautiful
sunsets	NNS
here

Lally
was
sure
that
we
would
get
sunstroke	NN
while
we
were
fishing

They
sat
there
,
admiring

suntans	NNS

He
looked
fit

his

sun-tanned	JJ

That
corner

supped	VBD

You

Ill
be

Once
,
there
had
been
a
superabundance	NN

make

This
species
is
famous
for
its
neat
foliage

superabundant	JJ
flowers

We
found
ourselves
aboard
a
superannuated	JJ
trawler
.

The
childrens
library
is
superb	JJ
...

Now
this
gives
you
,
I
think
,
a
superb	JJ
indication
of
his
capabilities
.

She
was
basking
in
superb	JJ
confidence
of
achievement

She
amazed
her
audiences
with
her
superb	JJ
authority
and
vocal
power
.

Teachers
sometimes
show
cruelty
by
being
supercilious	JJ
and
sarcastic
.

He
challenged
the
idea
of
womans
lack
of
a
super-ego	NN
,
her
dependence
upon
the
approval
of
others
.

Theyve
only
got
a
superficial	JJ
knowledge
of
linguistics

...
the
inadequacies
of
a
superficial	JJ
education
.

I
suddenly
realized
how
superficial	JJ
she
was
.

Most
of
the
wounds
were
only
superficial	JJ
.

Do
not
be
misled
by
the
superfluity	NN
of
allegedly
scientific
advice
.

Certain
parts

our
religion
have
become
superfluous	JJ

I
had
not

cant
control

There
is
something
superhuman	JJ
,
even
magical

alien
,
about
the
Pyramids
.

It
would
be
wrong

superimpose	VB

the
superintendent	NN
of

The
school
prided
itself
upon
its
policy
of
providing
a
superior	JJ
education
...

The
computer
is
vastly
superior	JJ
to
the
book
.

He
was
in
a
state
of
depression
because
of
a
warning
from
a
superior	JJ
civil
servant
...

These
matters

Who
did
Boylan
think

Im
always
feeling
superior	JJ
about

He
turned
to
me
with
a
superior	NN
and
sarcastic
smile
...

You
wouldnt
understand
,
Clarissa
said
in
a
superior	NN
way
.

He
was
from
a
caste
so
superior	JJ
to
their
own
...

They
counted
themselves
the
most
superior	JJ
race
in
the
world
.

Myra
was
his
social
superior	NN
...

Dont
go
giving
yourself
airs
as

her
superior	NN
.

He
was
called
to
the
office
of
a
superior	NN
to
be
reprimanded
...

He
was
extra
polite
to
his
superiors	NNS
lest
something
adverse
might
be
written
about
him
.

These
factors
did
much
to
offset
the
enemys
superior	JJ
numbers

The
Coronation

superlatives	NNS
on
the
English
genius
for

you

...

New
ways

superseded	VBN
older

The

up

In

The

My

My

...

Polish
it
regularly
to

it
supple	JJ
and
prevent

.

The
money

A

They
offered

Christian
Democrats

They
have
continued

attract

support	NN
from
outside
the
party
...

They
had
failed

mobilize
trade
union
support	NN
.

The
partys
support	NN
is
so
scattered
that
it
is
quite
powerless
.

His

He

to
sit
down
,
because
his
knees
wouldnt
support	VB
him
any
more
.

A
support	NN
is
something

.

Most
large

now

I
clung

She

We

support	VB

You
can
be
medically
examined

There
was
simply
no
visible
evidence

such
a
theory
.

Scholars
have
found
little
support	NN
for

In

view

Rose

It
was
quite
reasonable

wanted

...

No

supposes	VBZ
that
nuclear

The

Its
not
simply
a
drop
in

suppose	VB
.

That
he
resigned

a
not
very
unreasonable
supposition	NN
...

These
facts

plain
guesses
rest
on
a
central
suppositionthat

You

The

The

He

An

of
people
on
the
boat
talking	VBG
French
...

Its
one
thing
to
read
a
language
,
its
quite
different
when
you
have
to
talk	VB
it
.

We
used
to
sit
and
talk	VB
politics
all
evening
...

Lets
talk	VBP
a
little
business
,
shall
we
?

I
talked	VBD
yesterday
about
the
problems
facing
young
people
in
todays
society
...

He
has
an
ability
to
talk	VB
on
almost
any
topic
you
mention
.

Angus
Wilson
came
here
and
gave
a
talk	NN
last
week
...

This
term
we
are
having
talks	NNS
on
careers
overseas
.

One
shouldnt
talk	VB
of
an
agreement
but
rather
of
a
possible
compromise
...

When
you
talk	VBP
about
prose
and
poems
do
you
mean
literature
?

She
talked	VBD
herself
hoarse
...

She
talked	VBD
herself
into
a
state
of
righteous
indignation
.

At
least
the
superpowers
are
talking	VBG
to
one
another
.

Shy
students
are
sometimes
discouraged
by
the
more
talkative	JJ
members
of
the
class
...

John
wasnt
very
talkative	JJ
,
but
he
was
pleasant
to
be
with
.

He
is
very
much
at
ease
in
life
and
is
a
good
talker	NN
...

He
is
the
best
talker	NN
in
the
village
.

...
in
the
days
of
the
silent
film
and
the
early
talkies	NNS
.

My
teacher
gave
me
a
real
talking-to	NN
for
not
doing
my
homework
...

I
got
a
hell
of
a
talking-to	NN
when
I
got
home
.

He
was
a
tall	JJ
,
dark
and
undeniably
handsome
man
...

In
the
background
is
a
tall	JJ
cypress
tree
...

...
two
tall	JJ
glasses
of
pineapple
juice
.

The
door
was
opened
by
a
thin
,
tallish	JJ
woman
with
a
lined
face
.

Can
you
keep
a
tally	NN
of
your
own
marks
,
please?
...

The
tally	NN
had
now
reached
thirty-six
.

Weve
checked
their
stories
and
they
dont
quite
tally	VB
...

The
amount
she
said
she
had
received
failed
to
tally	VB
with
the
figure
shown
in
the
records
.

The
owls
formidable
talons	NNS
can
carry
birds
up
to
the
size
of
a
chicken
.

We
decided
to
let
it
go
because
it
would
never
have
got
tame	JJ
;
wild
birds
never
do
in
cages
...

...
a
tame	JJ
monkey
.

...
the
urbane
societies
of
the
West
,
with
their
tame	JJ
populations
made
gentle
by
decades
of
prosperity
.

It
sounded
like
a
rather
tame	JJ
party
.

He
made
quite
a
name
for
himself
taming	VBG
hawks
.

Within
two
years
they
had
tamed	VBN
this
inhospitable
landscape
.

This
urge
to
take
revenge
is
something
that
we
have
to
tame	VB
.

Her
bare
legs
and
arms
had
lost
all
their
tan	NN
.

He
was
never
going
to
tan	VB
,
no
matter
how
many
months
he
spent
in
the
sun
.

I
bought
a
pair

shoes

arrived

.

...
the
tang	NN
of
an
expensive
perfume
...

The
cologne
gave
a
tang	NN
to
the
air
around
him
.

My
remark
was
considered
somewhat
tangential	JJ
.

His
brief
rule
as
Prime
Minister
brought
few
tangible	JJ
benefits
to
the
poor
...

Then
there
are
less
tangible	JJ
factors
like
job
satisfaction
.

On
their
left
was
an
impenetrable
tangle	NN
of
creepers
and
trees
...

There
were
tangles	NNS
of
barbed
wire
on
the
wall
.

My
tax
affairs
were
in
a
complete
tangle	NN
.

A
legal
contract
does
help
to
straighten
out
the
tangles	NNS
when
the
relationship
breaks
up
.

...
messy
tangles	NNS
across
a
militarily
open
border
.

He
shouldnt
have
allowed
the
strings
of
the
parachute
to
tangle	VB
.

His
leg
may
have
got
tangled	VBN
in
a
harpoon
line
.

She
pushed
the
tangled	JJ
hair
back
from
her
face
...

...
tangled	JJ
string
...

The
wires
got
all
tangled	JJ
.

The
negotiations
became
hopelessly
tangled	JJ
and
confused
.

Can
you
do
the
tango	NN
?

The

Could
you
make

the
Tannoy	NN
?

Theyve
been
tantalizing	VBG
him
with
vague
hints
about
whats
happening
.

His
statement
was
tantamount	JJ
to
an
admission

responsibility

His
bail
was
so
low

it

I
heard

Do

told	VBD

anecdotes

telling	VBG

told	VBD
a
lot

lies

said
Bill

I
was
furious

told	VBD
them
to
get
out

my
house

Dont
argue
with
me
,
George

do
as
youre
told	VBN

Im
sorry
Im
late

my
aunt
told	VBD
me
not
to
run
,
he
explained
.

My
uncle
smiled
and
told	VBD
me
not
to
worry

I
told	VBD
him
to
get
a
good
lawyer

He
told	VBD
himself
it
was
only
a
game

Be
careful
,
she
told	VBD
herself
.
Be
very
careful
.

I
couldnt
tell	VB
what
they
were
thinking
...

It
was
impossible
to
tell	VB
which
island
they
came
from
...

So
far
as
we
can
tell	VB
,
it
is
still
in
perfect
condition
.

Dont
try
and
make
me
tell	VB
,
because
I
never
shall
...

Hes
won
a
lot
,
hasnt
he
?
Or
arent
you
telling	VBG
?

Every
movement
they
make
tells	VBZ
you
that
they
are
tired
...

My
intuition
told	VBD
me
to
stay
away
.

The
strain
was
beginning
to
tell	VB
...

All
these
late
nights
were
beginning
to
tell	VB
on
my
health

All
cows
look
the
same
to
me
,
I
can
never
tell	VB
one
from
another
.

Two
members
of
each
party
were
there
to
tell	VB
the
votes
.

Each
party
appointed
two
tellers	NNS
to
watch
the
vote
counting

Tellers	NNS
will
collect
the
ballot
forms

result

be
known

midnight

The
story
takes
more
than
five
hundred
pages
in
the
telling	VBG
...

The
earlier
tellings	NNS
of
the
story
had
concentrated
on
the
battle
.

The
lawyer
made
a
brief
,
telling	VBG
speech
to
the
magistrate
.

He
made
a
particularly
telling	VBG
remark
.

When
she
got
back
she
would
give
him
such
a
telling-off	NN
about
that
doll
.

His
head
was
totally
baldnot
shaven
,
for
there
were
no
telltale	JJ
black
spots
on
his
scalp

I
was
beginning
to
recognize

first
tell-tale
signs

panic

Did
you
see
The
Doctors
Dilemma
on
telly	NN

night

He
had
the
temerity	NN
to
suggest
that
a
few
changes
might
be
needed

Being

Im
temping	VBG
at

woman
has
as
much
right
to
work
as
a
man
...

I
think	VBP
that
you
should
go
...

Shes
cleverer
than
I
thought	VBD
...

What
did
you
think	VBP
of
her
?

She
thought	VBD
of
Deirdre
simply
as
an
old
chum
...

People
think	VBP
of
computers
as
being
devices
that
calculate
...

He
was
thought	VBN
by
the
Conservatives
to
be
an
extreme
radical
...

Milk
was
thought	VBN
a
luxury
.

You
expect
everyone
to
think	VB
like
you
...

Her
servants
thought	VBD
as
she
did
.

He
thought	VBD
for
a
moment
,
looked
us
up
and
down
,
and
still
said
nothing
...

Do
we
need
language
to
think	VB
or
to
communicate?
...

That
ought
to
make
us
all
think	VBP
hard
about
how
we
can
make
a
safer
product
...

...
the
society
in
which
most
of
us
live
without
even
thinking	VBG
about
it
.

Well
be
in
touch
when
weve
had
a
think	VBP
about
what
to
do
.

Im
trying
to
think	VB
which
other
companies
I
can
try
for
you
...

If
you
think	VBP
of
anything
else
,
ask
the
lady
here
...

I
can
never
think	VB
of
her
name
.

Im
thinking	VBG
here
particularly
of
doctors
...

One
thinks	VBZ
particularly
of
the
laws
on
divorce
.

All
the
while
I
was
thinking	VBG
,
Whats
happening
here?
...

What
it
was
to
have
a
friend
,
Deirdre
thought	VBD
...

I
lay
there
thinking	VBG
how
funny
it
was
.

Think	VBP
can
also
be
used
with
thought	VB
as
an
object
.

It
was
very
kind
of
you
to
think	VB
of
him
...

I
had
my
own
survival
to
think	VB
of
...

You
never
think	VBP
about
anybody
but
yourself
!

I
can
think	VB
of
at
least
two
examples
of
this
Governments
stupidity
...

He
can
think	VB
of
no
reason
for
going
on
living
.

...
a
method
which
,
so
far
as
he
knew
,
had
never
even
been
thought	VBN
of
before
...

I
kicked
myself
for
not
having
thought	VBN
of
it
earlier
.

Is
he
still
thinking	VBG
of
going
away
to
Italy
for
a
month?
...

I
thought	VBD
about
being
a
sports
reporter
...

I
keep
thinking	VBG
about
getting
a
flat
.

Who
do
you
think	VBP
you
are?
...

What
do
you
think	VBP
youre
doing
?

She
thinks	VBZ
a
lot
of
you
...

I
didnt
think	VBP
much
of
his
letter
.

To
think	VB
that
I
trusted
him!
...

When
I
think	VBP
of
how
she
went
on
about
Hughie

I
can
see
why
he
left
her

alike

the
new

He
hoped
we
would
come
round
to
his
way

thinking	VBG

...
a
reluctance
which
dominated

His

I

Truant	NN

Before

the

made
another
raid

There
was
a
big
truck	NN
parked
on

A
grocers
van
came
up
behind

began
hooting
to
get
by

We
heard
the
occasional
rumble
of
a
passing
truck	NN
.

The
farmer
drove
them
out
to
the
orchard
in
a
rusty
old
truck	NN
...

He
was
carted
away

Sallay

Glen

The
goods
were
trucked	VBN
to
a
warehouse
.

I
am
sick
of
having
to
truckle	VB
to
the
professors
.

There
was
a
whole
truckload	NN
of
us
.

He
was
a
truculent	JJ
and
quarrelsome
man
.

There
was
a
stream
of
refugees
trudging	VBG
up
the
valley

the
border

He
trudged	VBD
wearily
along
the
path

They
set
off
before

for
the
long
trudge	NN

The
story
about
the
murder
is
true	JJ
...

She
gave
the
true	JJ
account
of
what
had
happened
...

Unfortunately
it
was
true	JJ
about
the
illness
of
little
Sylvie
.

Two-thirds
of
the
energy
from
power
stations
is
wasted
;
the
same
is
true	JJ
of
nuclear
power

Research
also
shows
that
what
is
true	JJ
for
ability
is
also
true	JJ
for
achievement
.

He
looked
through
the
telescopic
sight
until
he
was
convinced
his
aim
was
true	JJ
.

The
window
frame
isnt
quite
true	JJ
.

He
soon
became
a
reliable
true-blue	JJ
country

.

He
gave
her
a
box
of
truffles	NNS
for
Christmas
.

He
would
go
after
it
like
a
pig
after
truffles	NNS
.

It
is
a
trite
and
obvious
truism	NN
that
people
act
in

motives
.

He
knew
he
had
behaved
badly

he
seemed
truly	RB
sorry

She
didnt
let
anyone
know
what
she
truly	RB
felt

And
truly	RB
,
coming
home
was
about
the
nicest
part

the
evening

She
trumped	VBD
his
news
by
announcing
that
she
had
been
picked

the
Olympic

.

He
put

Hes

I
dont

The
two
elephants
stretch
up
their
necks

trumpet	VBP
a
celebratory
chorus

The
elephants
trumpet	NN
was
very
loud
and
rather
frightening
.

This
ideology
was
being
trumpeted	VBN
very
effectively
by
highly
committed
party
members

The
local
newspaper
had
trumpeted	VBN
for

useful
vote

The
truncated	VBD|VBN
corpse
was
stuffed

Last
night
police
with
truncheons	NNS
fought
a
pitched
battle

40

We
watched
the
combine
harvesters
trundling	VBG
through
the
ripening
maize

The
lorry
turned
the
corner

trundled	VBN
up

She
saw
him
every
Saturday
,
trundling	VBG

push

along

nearby
park

I
trundled	VBD
along
to
the
enquiry
office

The
other
two
trundled	VBN
off
into

I
sat
down
on

fallen
tree

thought
deeply
.

We
had
to
go

The
bank
robbers
trussed	VBN
up
the
manager

his
staff
and
locked
them
in
the
vault
.

Everybody
liked

trusted	VBD
him

You
can
never
trust	VB

I
trust	VBP

She

Shes
not
a

I
can
trust	VB
with
this
sort
of
secret

Next
year
I
hope
the
company
will
trust	VB
me
with
a
bigger
budget
.

I
slowly
found
myself
able
again
to
hope
and
trust	VB
in
the
human
race
.

Im
not
sure
I
trust	VB

I
dont
trust	VB

He
wanted

get
up

walk
out

he
didnt
trust	VB
his
legs

Dont
be
afraid
to
trust	VB
your

Trust	VB

She
seems
to
trust	VB
his
advice
about
people
.

The
people
of
England
are
discovering
that
it
is
no
good
trusting	VBG
to
the
old
politicians

I
suppose
well
just
have
to
trust	VB

They

give
you

I

charitable

Local

Two

There

There
is

an
element

in
this
argument

I
could
not
deny
the
truth	NN
of
this
statement
.

Its
a
book
that
contains
important

The
purpose

...
a
universal
truth	NN

Being
truthful	JJ
is
a
profoundly
practical
thing

Many
patients
are
more
truthful	JJ
when
they
talk

the
computer

when
they
talk
to

It
was
decided
that

After
a

tries	NNS
they
gave
up

Its

worth

We
must
try	VB

They
turned	VBD
their
guns
on

She
turned	VBD
green
eyes
on
him
.

There
was
a
long
line

They

They

Her

was
all
crumpled

turned	VBN
up
at
the

.

I
wonder
if
we
can
turn	VB
our
attention

something
you
mentioned
earlier

His
thoughts
turned	VBD

Turning	VBG

him

What
could
I
do

Where
could
I

He
served
as
a
civil
servant
for
a
while
before
turning	VBG

political
life
...

Most
farmers
had
turned	VBN
from
crops

cattle
...

The
magistrates
have
turned	VBN
to
other
measures
.

If
you
apply
more
heat
,
of
course
the
water
turns	VBZ

...

Soon
her
glee
turned	VBD

fear

...
a
dramatist
turned	VBD
scriptwriter
.

Those
who
had
turned	VBN
fifteen
could
leave

they
wanted
to
...

What
time
is
it?Just
turned	VBD
three
.

I
think
we
missed
our
turn	NN
back

In

How
long
was
the
turnaround	NN
on

last

Take
the
third
turning	NN
on
the

We
must
have
missed

Despite
hopes

they

I
tussled	VBD

managed

wrench

When

This
name
may
be
unfamiliar	JJ
to
most
of
you
.

...
a
person
unfamiliar	JJ
with
French
speech
.

...
the
unfashionable	JJ
side
of
Victoria
Station
...

His
ideas
were
unfashionable	JJ
and
unpopular
among
his
colleagues
.

The
present
crisis
has
largely
been
caused
by
an
unfavourable	JJ
economic
climate
...

...
unfavourable	JJ
weather
conditions
.

He
had
formed
an
unfavourable	JJ
opinion
of
my
work
...

This
might
perhaps
create
an
unfavourable	JJ
impression
.

She
had
been
drawing
unfavourable	JJ
comparisons
between
standards
here
and
abroad
.

Hes
a
corrupt
,
unfeeling	JJ
little
creep
.

...
the
right
of
free
speech
,
unfettered	JJ
by
the
party
system
...

They
want
to
replace
one
form
of
unfettered	JJ
power
with
another
.

People
shouldnt
leave
jobs
unfinished	JJ
...

Theres
a
lot
of
unfinished	JJ
business
to
get
through
.

This
meat
is
unfit	JJ
for
human
consumption
...

Adams
is
clearly
unfit	JJ
to
hold
an
administrative
post
.

They
introduced
western
styles
of
education
which
unfitted	VBD
people
for
a
constructive
role
in
society
.

She
felt
encouraged
by
his
unflagging	JJ
attention
...

...
a
lifetime
of
unflagging	JJ
scrutiny
.

...
an
unflattering	JJ

description
of
the

...
his
unfocused	JJ
gaze
resting
on
each
peak
in
turn
.

My
reaction
to
his
story
as
it
unfolded	VBD
was
one
of
amazement
...

The
great
invasion
plan
was
beginning
to
unfold	VB
.

She
had
soon
unfolded	VBD
all
her
plans
to
him
...

Taking
a
deep
breath
,
I
unfolded	VBD
my
proposals
.

She
thrust
a
small
piece
of
paper
at
me
.
I
unfolded	VBD
it
.

This
was
an
unforeseen	JJ
complication
.

It
was
an
unforgettable	JJ
experience
...

...
the
unforgettable	JJ
sound
of
air-raid
sirens
.

...
an
unforgivable	JJ
error
in
judgement
...

It
is
unforgivable	JJ
to
wound
an
animal
instead
of
killing
it
.

He
is
unforgiving	JJ
to
his
enemies
.

Some
of
the
boys
taunted
those
unfortunates	NNS
still
working
in
the
fields
.

It
is
rather
unfortunate	JJ
that
the
Prime
Minister
should
have
said
this
...

Its
sad
about
that
young
boy
.
It
was
an
unfortunate	JJ
business
...

...
one
of
those
unfortunate	JJ
lulls
in
the
conversation
.

He
couldnt
wait
to
tell
Judy
.
Unfortunately	RB
she
had
already
left
for
work
...

Unfortunately	RB
for
you
,
your

never

...

Will
you

,
unfortunately	RB
I
wont
.

Mr
King
called
the
allegations
untrue
and
unfounded	JJ
...

Our
worst
fears
have
proved
unfounded	JJ
.

He
looked
unfriendly	JJ
...

Why
have
you
now
come
to
see
me
,
when
you
were
so
unfriendly	JJ
to
me
before
.

...
twelve
years
of
unfruitful	JJ
experience
...

This
line
of
questioning
proved
unfruitful	JJ
.

He
has
a
sense
of
unfulfilled	JJ
destiny
...

...
a
country
with
unfulfilled	JJ
potential
for
tourism
.

You
wont
find
me
ungenerous	JJ
.

I
felt
as
we
talked
that
I
had
been
ungenerous	JJ
to
George
...

I
should
not
be
ungenerous	JJ
in
my
thoughts
.

Well
make
the
province
ungovernable	JJ
.

Dont
be
so
ungracious	JJ
...

...
an
ungracious	JJ
reply
.

I
dont
want
to
sound
ungrateful	JJ
...

It
was
ungrateful	JJ
of
me
.

I
couldnt
go
without
leaving
my
suitcase
unguarded	JJ
.

I
told
him
,
in
an
unguarded	JJ
moment
,
what
I
planned
to
do
.

His
comment
drew
unguarded	JJ
support
from
the
others
.

This
would
give
black
people
the
opportunity
to
live
unhampered	JJ
by
racism
...

The
new
stock
market
is

He
trudged
unhappily	RB
along
the
crunchy
gravel
towards
the
house
...

The
first
week
of
school
had
passed
unhappily	RB
.

Unhappily	RB
,
George
Devine
had
died
by
the
time
Ralph
got
to
America
...

Unhappily	RB
,
due
to
the
present
local
difficulties
we
are
unable
to
supply
you
with
these
goods
...

But
it
is
also
unhappily	RB
clear
that
these
demands
are
unreasonable
.

Id
rarely
seen
a
man
look
so
unhappy	JJ
...

He
lapsed
into
an
unhappy	JJ
silence
...

I
had
an
unhappy	JJ
time
at
school
.

The
residents
of
the
area
are
unhappy	JJ
about
the
crowds
and
the
noise
...

He
was
unhappy	JJ
with
the
returns
on
his
investments.
...

Id
be
rather
unhappy	JJ
to
see
that
happen
.

This
unhappy	JJ
state
of
affairs
would
not
exist
if
all
Ministers
acted
in
a
responsible
way
...

He
referred
in
his
speech
to
an
unhappy	JJ
accident
that
had
taken
place
only
a
few
months
earlier
...

...
an
unhappy	JJ
phrase
.

The
four
men
managed
to
escape
unharmed	JJ
...

The
plane
was
diverted
to
allow
a
flight
of
wild
geese
to
go
on
their
way
,
unharmed	JJ
,
to
the
South
.

This
is
probably
the
most
unhealthy	JJ
place
in
the
world
...

Damp
clothes
are
unhealthy	JJ
.

The
wishes
of
the
minority
go
unheard	JJ
...

He
wrote
me
off
,
unheard	JJ
,
long
before
my
trial
.

His
cries
would
have
gone
unheeded	JJ
...

Our

were
unheeded	JJ

He
didnt

The

According

Gordon
Masters

quite
unhinged	JJ
.

...
an
unholy	JJ
union
of
dark
and
ancient
superstitions
...

I
discovered
the
unholy	JJ
pleasures
of
gossip
and
malice
.

She
followed
him
into
the
hall
,
where
he
unhooked	VBD
his
hat
and
coat
.

Her
voice
was
calm

unhurried	JJ
...

There
were
a
lot

people
strolling
about
in
an
unhurried	JJ

The

unhurt	JJ

climbed

Two

Many

convinced

There

On

Barneys

Worldwide

For

an

The

Her

him

This

He

Franklin

This

All

Their
treatment

My

disown

She
made

up
smoking

I
told
him
to
remember
his
vow	NN
about
not
competing

He
spoke
very
carefully
,
sharply
enunciating
each
vowel	NN

baring
his

If

all
you
get

a
load

filthy

I
just
gave
him
a
V-sign	NN

ran

If
a
defeated
politician
performs
the
victory
V-sign	NN
,
it
may
reflect
his
fighting
spirit

He
wore
vulgar	JJ
,
commercialized
spectacles
...

What
is
now
admired
as
Art
Deco
was
then
scorned

vulgar	JJ
extravagance

The
boys
had
scrawled
some
outrageously
vulgar	JJ
graffiti
about
him
in
the
loo

It
was
quite
a
vulgar	JJ
play

They

consider
you

She
did
not
like
him

it
was
vulgar	NN

Elderly

Lack

Children
go
through
a
very
vulnerable	JJ
age

Their
participation

has
made
them
much
more
vulnerable	JJ

the
corruption

power
.

These
are
the
points
on
which
Giscard

This

Any

One

I
could
hear

He
raised
a

I
didnt

...

He
sat
in
the
middle

Christmas
presents
wailing	VBG
that
the
one
thing
he
really
wanted

There
was
a
plaintive
wail	NN

What

She
tied
an

Has

She
waltzed	VBD
across

sat
down

He
looked
suddenly

wan	JJ

said

She

The

wandered	VBD

I
think

Tie
him
to
a
tree
with
a
bit

he
wont

He
used
the
dogs

reassemble
his
goats

had
begun

wander	VB

When
she

My

This

fancied

I

The

A

rose

In

What
you

The

were
able

jam
this

After
some
wavering	VBG
I
accepted
this

I
looked

They

The

fleshy

slightly
waxy	JJ

She
is
convinced

He

He

I
never

that
I

Im

Do

The

She

Political

It

Angry

The

It

25
metres

30
tons

He

The

Im
not

heavy

can
I
carry

His

The

The

he
was
wrongly
imprisoned

They
had
the
weight	NN
of
European
official
support
behind
them

The
sheer
numerical
weight	NN
of
demonstrators
produced
a
bitter
confrontation
.

The
fact
that
he
is
captain
of
the
hockey
team
does
not
give
his
voice
added
weight	NN
in
a
General
School
Meeting
.

This
was
a
great
weight	NN
lifted
off
my
back

Without
a
producer
,
the
weight	NN

responsibility
fell
upon

The
fathers
of
many

groan
under
the
weight	NN

paying
large
sums

The

Let
us
turn
to
less
weighty	JJ
matters
...

This
was
a
subject
most
of
the
people
thought
weighty	JJ
and
dull
.

...
the
problems
involved

carrying
weighty	JJ

noisy
infants

The
markets
sell
all
sorts

weird	JJ
vegetables

The
time
I
spent
with
him
had
had
a
weird	JJ
effect
on
me
...

Peculiar
things
have
happened
before
,
but
this
is
even
weirder	JJR
.

He
wasnt
mad
but
he
was
certainly
weird	JJ
.

When
we
started
up
,
the
locals
thought
we
were
weirdos	NNS
.

He
moved
eagerly
towards
the
door
to
welcome	VB
his
visitor
...

Vernon
welcomed	VBD
me
back

a

a
handshake

Youll

the
staff
of
the
Dispatch
,
son
...

All
members
of
the
public
are
welcome	JJ
...

It
was
clear
some
members
were
more
welcome	JJ
than
others
...

Because
I
was
neutral
in
the
conflict
I
was
a
welcome	JJ
visitor
in
both
camps
.

You
know

always
be
welcome	JJ

Youre

I
warmly
welcomed	VBD
his
proposal

First
of
all
I
think
we
must
welcome	VB
the
Report
...

This
legislation
is
particularly
welcomed	VBN
.

Victorias
marriage
was
not
welcomed	VBN
by
the
family
...

He
welcomed	VBD
the
long
days
of
hard
work
,
for
they
kept
him
from
thinking
too
much
.

These
awards
are
a
welcome	JJ
tribute

Radio

a

cup

A

welcome	JJ
.

Should
she
be
cool

withdrawn
,

warm

welcoming	JJ
?

It
takes
speed

skill

Put

task

I

I
was
very
well	RB
aware

frail

We
managed

They
each
suspected
only
too
well	RB
what
the

They

On

I
share
your
concern
about
what	WP
is
rapidly
becoming
a
desperate
situation

I
went
to
the

read

could
find
about
Robert
Owens

He
volunteered

could

lying
around

had
given
up
whatever	WDT
hopes

had

You

any
chance

None

I

no

he
climbed
up

All
this
was
said
very
slowly

There

times

This

one

I

Im

Now

While	IN

Poirot
had
been
wondering
,
while	IN
eating
his
dinner
,
what
it
was
that
was
driving
Mrs
Oliver
to
visit
him
.

While	IN
he
was
turning
the
key
in
the
lock
,
someone
opened
a
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
corridor
...

The
car
got
three
severe
bumps
while	IN
parked
in
the
street
in
London
...

He
had
taken
out
his
handkerchief
several
times
while	IN
talking
to
her
and
blown
his
nose
.

One

Fred
gambled
his
money
away
while	IN
Julia
spent
hers
all
on

bric-a-brac
.

So
while	IN
I
have
sympathy
for
these
fellows
who
reacted
against
the
formality
of
their
predecessors
,
I
think
they
went
too
far
...

Your
missive
,
while	IN
complete
in
other
regards
,
skirted
the
subject

cost

She
might
go

might
not
,
as
the
whim	NN

I
was
listening

Nearby

broken
leg

I
pressed
the
button

the
clattering

elevator
began

My
father
was
a
brave
man
who
never
whined	VBD

complained
about
his
illness
.

He
was
annoying
Sarah
with
his
non-stop
whining	NN
.

Again
he
was
lashed
with
whips	NNS
.

I
saw
him
whipping	VBG

team

The
whipped	VBN
child

He
could
not
possibly
have
endured
a
whipping	NN
without
a
moan
or
a
whimper
.

The
wind
whipped	VBN
my
face
.

All
that
could
be
seen

ship
were

I
whipped	VBN
out

hundred-dollar
bill

Glenn
whipped	VBN
off

reveal
his
identity

He
took
hold
of
the
cheque
and
whipped	VBN
it
away
.

I
whipped	VBN
in
,
got
my
coat
,
whipped	VBN
out
,
and
got
back
in
the
car

the
sound

the
ball
whipping	VBG
past
my
nose

He
heard
the
wind
whipping	VBG
through
the
trees
.

His
men
were
not
a
particularly
brave
lot
,

they
could
be
whipped	VBN
into
a
frenzy
.

Theres
ten
tins
in
the
back
I
whipped	VBN
from

We
flung

whisked	VBN

With

The

She

When

What

We
spoke

There

There

Hagen
whistled	VBN

The

The
prevailing
Wall

No

to
work	VB
a
ten-hour
day
,
Monday
to
Friday
...

On
the
evenings
when
he
was
not
working	VBG
,
Jo
liked
to
visit
the
bars
in
town
.

All
through
the
winter
term
,
the
Kirks
worked	VBD
on
their
terrace
house
...

She
had
gone
down
into
the
cellar
where
her
father
was
working	VBG
.

You
havent
worked	VBN
but
youll
pass
your
exams
.

He
had
worked	VBN
the
London
area
for
several
publishers
...

They
work	VBP
the
streets
round
Paddington
.

People
who
have
never
worked	VBN
with
steel
have
trouble
understanding
this
...

He
always
works	VBZ
in
oil
paints
.

Hed
visited
a
commune
and
watched
the
peasants
and
intellectuals
working	VBG
the
land
together
...

The
farmers
are
now
able
to
work	VB
a
much
larger
area
with
a
smaller
workforce
.

There
had
been
as
many
as
180
Norwegians
working	VBG
the
coal
mines
at
Tunheim
...

For
the
men
who
work	VBP
the
wells
it
will
be
a
tough
life
.

From
inside
the
garage
there
came
the
sound
of
Coyne
working	VBG
a
lathe
...

I
ran
off
to
help
the
boy
who
worked	VBD
the
milking
machine
.

I
thought
your
bell
worked	VBD
...

The
traffic
lights
werent
working	VBG
properly
.

In
terms
of
theatrical
effect
,
it
seems
to
me
to
work	VB
amazingly
well
...

That
kind
of
democracy
will
never
work	VB
...

Frankness
works	VBZ
best
.

How
long
does
a
sleeping
pill
take
to
work	VB
?

There
is
a
special
wire
cutter
which
works	VBZ
off
a
battery
...

He
assiduously
applied
himself
to
learning
how
Parliament
worked	VBD
.

He
can
count
on
this
factor
working	VBG
in
his
favour
...

All
these
factors
work	VB
against
the
young
entrant
to
the
labour
market
...

The
restraining
influence
seemed
to
be
working	VBG
on
both
sides
.

His
brain
is
working	VBG
furiously
to
cope
with
the
complexities
.

They
work	VBP
also
for
international
peace
...

We
worked	VBD
hard
to
persuade
them
that
we
were
genuinely
interested
.

I
had
the
opportunity
to
work	VB
with
a
great
many
foster
children
...

I
worked	VBD
with
the
masses
on
land
reform
.

He
has
been
working	VBG
all
season
on
his
game
...

She
works	VBZ
hard
at
keeping
herself
fit
.

Someone
must
have
worked	VBN
at
it
with
a
crowbar
...

He
worked	VBD
on
the
lock
with
a
nail
file
and
finally
managed
to
get
the
door
to
open
.

Mr
Reagan
said
he
was
working	VBG
on
the
assumption
that
formal
negotiations
would
shortly
take
place
...

Evolution
theory
works	VBZ
on
the
idea
that
the
fittest
survive
and
produce
fit
offspring
.

As
soon
as
an
idea
tentatively
appears
,
it
is
quickly
worked	VBN
into
a
form
suitable
for
an
experimental
programme
.

The
ropes
had
worked	VBN
loose
...

The
thin
frock
worked	VBD
up
as
she
bent
over
.

She
was
working	VBG
herself
into
a
rage
about
his
attitude
.

She
worked	VBD
it
so
that
he
never
had
a
chance
to
be
at
home
on
his
own
.

The
flood
of
warm
golden
stage
lighting
was
working	VBG
its
magic
on
the
audience
.

I
worked	VBD
my
way
slowly
out
of
the
marsh
...

Gridgeley
left
school
at
14
,
and
worked	VBD
his
way
up
to
the
position
of
Head
of
Supplies
...

I
worked	VBD
my
way
through
his
writings
.

The
men
huddled
down
in
the
trench
worked	VBD
their
lips
to
ease
the
dryness
...

His
face
worked	VBD
expressively
before
the
words
came
out
.

You
work	VBP
a
percentage
in
a
table
.

...
the
brick
works	NNS
...

...
a
printing
works	NNS
...

He
was
the
works	NNS
foreman
.

Nice
work	NN
,
Jack
...

Thank
you
,
he
said
,
that
was
quick
work	NN
.

This
doesnt
seem
to
me
to
be
a
workable	JJ
system
...

We
will
examine
the
test
and
see
how
workable	JJ
it
is
.

On
one
side
ran
a
long
wooden
workbench	NN
with
shelves
above
cluttered
with
boxes
.

Regan
could
hold
to
a
9-to-5
workday	NN
,
with
occasional
Friday
afternoons
off
.

The
dispute
affected
relations
between
management
and
workers	NNS
...

We
went
to
the
home
of
a
woman
factory
worker	NN
named
Liang
.

A
series
of
experiments
by
American
research
workers	NNS
have
provided
some
of
the
answers
...

Rescue
workers	NNS
are
hoping
to
reach
the
trapped
man
by
midnight
.

The
workers	NNS
have
little
pollen
baskets
on
their
legs
...

...
a
worker	NN
bee
.

Asias
workforce	NN
will
expand
by
60
per
cent
.

We
are
now
able
to
work
a
much
larger
area
with
a
smaller
workforce	NN
...

They
had
since
1969
agreed
to
reduce
the
workforce	NN
by
3500
.

I
milked
the
cows
and
led
the
workhorses	NNS
to
the
watering
trough
.

Jerrys
always
a
willing
workhorse	NN
.

They
tramped
from
workhouse	NN
to
workhouse	NN
...

The
ultimate
dread
was
the
workhouse	NN
.

They
are
asking
for
a
cut
in
the
working	JJ
week
to
an
average
of
thirty
hours
...

The
unions
will
be
demanding
a
reduction
in
working	JJ
hours
.

It
was
an
ordinary
working	JJ
day
for
them
...

People
are
now
losing
their
jobs
each
and
every
working	JJ
day
.

60
per
cent
of
these
people
spend
their
entire
working	JJ
lives
at
General
Motors
...

Over
the
next
few
years
there
will
be
more
people
of
working	JJ
age
in
our
society
.

Shes
a
part
of
the
working	JJ
population
of
this
country
just
the
same
as
you
.

All
this
is
detrimental
to
peaceful
working	JJ
relations
...

...
a
close
working	JJ
relationship
.

The
kitchen
on
any
working	JJ
farm
is
the
centre
of
things
.

Minute
computers
with
minute
working	JJ
components
are
invaluable
in
this
kind
of
work
.

In
the
first
week
I
picked
up
a
tolerable
working	JJ
knowledge
.

...
a
precarious
working	JJ
majority
of
four
.

This
is
a
good
general
purpose
working	JJ
definition
.

The
company
has
always
been
associated
with
iron
workings	NNS
...

They
now
had
a
monopoly
of
the
big
workings	NNS
.

Often
union
positions
entail
a
workload	NN
that
is
quite
impossible
to
combine
with
doing
a
job
...

The
critics
will
shut
up
once
profits
improve
and
their
own
workload	NN
increases
.

On
the
very
first
day
of
school
,
workmen	NN
arrived
and
put
up
a
fence
.

This
happened
in
front
of
his
friends
,
neighbours
and
workmates	NNS
.

He
felt
relaxed
because
of
the
light
workout	NN
he
had
just
done
.

A
workshop	NN
was
built
on
Babbages
estate
,
skilled
workmen
hired
and
construction
got
underway
...

...
a
small
engineering
workshop	NN
.

I
watched
Franklin
as
he
chaired
a
workshop	NN
on
the
subject
of
Black
Politics
and
Economics
...

She
runs
a
theatre
workshop	NN
.

What
does
the
party
have
to
gain
by
saying
that
the
unemployed
are
work-shy	JJ
?

The
kitchen
has
a
tiled
floor
and
worktop	NN
units
.

The
bus
drivers
were
planning
a
work-to-rule	NN
.

He
attempted
to

to
stay

poverty

We
are
now
moving
forward
into
a
world	NN
which
will
be
more

by

high
reputation
in

I
found
myself
entering

of
hypothesis

speculation

a
semi-magical

After

wouldnt

They
wrangled	VBN
over
whose
turn
it
was
to
do
the
washing
up
.

This
debate
is
a
dry
,
procedural
wrangle	NN
.

They
wrote
the
news
on
a
piece
of
paper
,
wrapped	VBD
it
round
a
stone
,
and
threw
it

Take

wreaked	VBD
by
heavy
bombardment

He
wanted
to
wreak	VB
revenge
on
his
colleagues
.

They
all
went
to
lay
wreaths	NNS
in
front

the
statue

...
a
funeral
wreath	NN
.

He
was
dressed
in
a
kilt
and
laurel
wreath	NN
.

The
dawn
sky
was
pale
,
the
sun
was
wreathed	VBD
in
mist
...

The
woman
was
sitting
wreathed	VBD
in
smoke
...

Smoke

I
wrecked	VBD

acres

wasteland
,
covered
with
wrecked	VBD
cars

rubbish
.

Im
sorry
if
I
wrecked	VBD
your
weekend
...

He
wrecked	VBD
my
only
serious
relationship
.

Many
Spanish
vessels
were
wrecked	VBD
off
the
North
American
coast
.

All
around
were
the
wrecks	NNS
of
previous
crashes
.

The
seabed
where
the
wreck	NN
lies
is
level
and
rocky
.

Experts
arrived
to
examine
the
wreckage	NN
of
a
cargo
plane
...

They
hauled
Peter
clear
of
the
wreckage	NN
.

He
believed
that
it
was
now
time
to
consider
how
much
could
be
saved
from
the
wreckage	NN
of
Government
policies
...

...
contemplating
the
wreckage	NN
of
my
attempted
careers
in
law
and
politics
.

These
people
are
the
relationship
wreckers	NNS
and
the
misery
producers
.

So
I
set
about
trying
to
wrench	VB
my
button
off
...

He
tried
desperately
to
wrench	VB
away
the
club
...

I
wrenched	VBN
the
door
open
.

With
a
wrench	NN
,
Eileen
gained
possession
of
the
crayon
again
.

Travers
grabbed
his
arm
.
David
wrenched	VBN
free
and
went
on
furiously
:
You
dont
understand!
...

She
wrenched	VBN
herself
away
from
him
.

She
wrenched	VBN
her
arm
badly
.

I
tried
to
wrench	VB
my
gaze
away
from
the
appalling
sight
...

Finally
he
would
wrench	VB
his
mind
away
to
something
else
.

It
was
a
great
wrench	NN
to
leave
the
home
where
I
had
been
so
happy
.

He
wrested	VBN
the
knife
from
her
...

He
barely
tasted
the
small
piece
he
managed
to
wrest	VB
away
for
himself
.

...
the
near-impossibility
of
wresting	VBG
the
seat
from
the
United
Party

His
nephew
wrested	VBN
away
control
of
the
company
.

He
taught
his
little
brother
how
to
wrestle	VB
...

John
wrestled	VBD
with
the
intruder
...

The
men
grabbed
him
again
,
wrestling	VBG
him
to
the
ground
.

For
decades

mathematicians

Viktor
Kowalski
was

telephone
enquiries

She
wondered
if
she
should
go

help
the
man
wrestle	VB
with
the
map

He
was

terrible
deed

the
wretch	NN
who
shot
down

President

And
the
poor
wretch	NN
put
his
head
down
on
the
table
and
groaned
.

That
wretched	JJ
woman
,
what
she
went
through
God
knows

She
spent
most

the
day

room
lying
down

feeling
wretched	JJ

I
was
wretched	JJ
afterwards

thinking
what
Id
done

you

The
dressing
rooms
were
wretched	JJ

Her
own
poverty
meant

child
had

diet

He
insisted

telling
his
wretched	JJ
story

I
had
to
remount

wretched	JJ
animal
.

The
children
were
wriggling	VBG
in
anticipation

She
wriggled	VBD

toes

My
father
started
wriggling	VBG
about
in
his
chair
.

Are
we
nearly
there
?
she
said
with
an
impatient
wriggle	NN
.

We
had
to
wriggle	VB
under
the
fence

When
the
tadpoles
hatch
,
they
immediately
wriggle	VBP
to
the
male
and
climb
on
his
back
.

He
looked
dazed
and
wrung	VB
his
hands
.

David
was
wringing	VBG
my
heart
with
his
pitiful
little
efforts
to
help
.

His
small
eyes
were
surrounded
by
many
wrinkles	NNS
.

She
brushed
out
the
wrinkles	NNS
in
her
dress
nervously
...

The
prime
ministers
toe
fidgeted
with

carpet

Make
sure
you
clean
the

Hes
always

me
that
the
sun
will
wrinkle	VB
my
skin

He
wrinkled	VBD
his
nose
,
as
if
detecting
a
foul
smell
...

Jordache
wrinkled	VBD
his
forehead

was
trying

remember
something

...
a
very
old
woman
with
a
wrinkled	JJ
face

She
looked
over
her
shoulder

make
sure
her
dress
wasnt
wrinkled	JJ
at
the
back
...

The
flowers
have
wrinkled	JJ
brown
petals

She
grabbed
her
husband
firmly
by
the
wrist	NN
and
dragged
him
away
...

Her
body
seemed
shrunken
and
her
wrists	NNS
and
ankles
pitifully
thin
.

He
reacted
instead
by
issuing
a
writ	NN
for
libel
against
the
magazine
.

I
always
felt
that
I
wanted

She
was
looking

He

In

can
also
write	VB
someone

If
there

All
the

Dr
Lostock
of
Yale
,
seems
to
confirm
this
suggestion.
...

He
wrote	VBD
that
he
was
never
depressed
by
anything
.

I
wrote	VBD
a
cheque
for
100
...

Ill
write	VB
you
a
prescription

I
did

What
sources
did

which
to
base

His
body
writhed	VBD
,
his
face
contorted
,
his
eyes
rolled
wildly
...

He
writhed	VBD
in
agony

Writing	VBG
has
made
me
a
millionaire

...
a
course

the
small

sloping
writing	NN

knew

well

I
cant
read

The
idea
crops
up

increasing
frequency

the
writings	NNS

scientists

His
political
writings	NNS
remind

The

If

You
