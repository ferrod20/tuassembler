We

Will
you

this

parent
act?

She

He

He
defended

It
has
a

smooth

Some
washing

They
felt
they

All

you

These

obviously
answering	VBG

I
think
the

No

You

What
would
your

be
to
the
accusation
that
you

old-fashioned?

In
answer	
to

I
would
suggest

completely
misunderstood

How

you
answer	VB

There

He

You

They

Behave	VB

said
Mrs

The

the

It
was
the
bitterest	JJS
blow

The

He
was
blind	JJ

one
eye

We
went
to
the
blind	JJ
school
.

used
as
a
verb
.
The
blind	VB
is
used
to
refer
to
people
who
are
blind	VB
.

The
acid
went
on
her
face
and
blinded	VBD|VBN
her
.
What
do
you
think
of
the
help
thats
given
to
the
blind	VB
?

My
eyes
were
momentarily
blinded	VBD|VBN
by
flash
bulbs
...

The
dust
from
the
roads
in
the
summertime
was
enough
to
blind	VBN
you
.

She
had
trodden
on
the
broken
bottle
,
blind	JJ
as
she
was
with
tears
and
rage
.

She
slammed
the
window
down
and
pulled
the
blind	
.

I
realized
how
blind	JJ
the
series
had
made
me
.

We
have
to
beware
that
missionary
zeal
doesnt
blind	VB
us
to
the
realities
here
.

The
girls
were
completely
blind	JJ
to
the
consequences
of
their
actions
...

They
were
not
blind	JJ
to
the
defects
of
Western
society
.

The
outward
part
of
this
first
mission
had
been
flown
blind	RB
.

The
room
facing
the
lake
presented
blind	VBD
and
shuttered
windows
to
the
evening
guests
.

The
big
block
proves
on
approach
to
be
blind	VBG
,
with
all
the
windows
boarded
up
.

Renshaw
probably
saw
through
the
blind	NN
,
but
listened
calmly
to
it
all
.

Editing
a
newspaper
in
that
country
was
like
walking
blindfold	RB
across
a
minefield
.

I
guarantee
I
could
read
that
script
blindfold	RB
,
Ive
been
through
it
so
many
times

Hiroshima
vanished
in

light

A
few
men
were
shooting
blindly	RB
into
the
flames
...

His
arm
was
on
fire
and
he
ran
blindly	RB
across
the
clearing
,
screaming
.

With
the
information
we
have
now
,
we
can
only
speculate
blindly	RB
...

Of
course
it
is
wrong
for
young
people
to
accept
blindly	RB
existing
standards
.

It
was
his
guilty
blink	
that
always
gave
us
away
.

Dots
and
dashes
blinked	VBD|VBN
out
from
a
signal
light
.

There
was
a
blink	
of
bright
light
beyond
the
forest
.

...
this
sense
of
having
blinkers	
put
on
you
.

After
those
blissful	JJ
two
years
,
I
began
to
hate
school
...

They
sat
there
together
in
blissful	JJ
silence
.

His
boots
had

him
blisters	NNS
on
his
heels

the
blistering	JJ
days
of
midsummer

blistering	JJ
heat

was

unusually
blithe	JJ

dauntless
.

blitzing

Queens
Hall

Portland

Were
going
to
have
a
blitz	
on
the
house
and
get
it
all
decorated
by
Christmas
.

You
should
aim
to
feel
satisfied
but
not
bloated	VBD
after
a
meal
.

He
saw
the
white
blob	NN
of
Fanucci
crossing
the
street
...

You
see
a
blob	
of
grey
in

distance

This
would
upset

balance

the
East-West

If

The

His
threats
are
merely
bluff	
.

Her
only
chance
was
to
use
her
wits
to
bluff	VB
and
outsmart
the
enemy
.

Signing

agreement
was

I
noticed

.

The
trees

The

She
bounced	VBD|VBN
the

once

serving

Bats

Its

jingled
on
my

were
set
up

bridge	VB
the

The

Theres

This

long

As
they

they
exchange
only
the

They
started
with
a

description
of

Mrs

made
a

note

For

Good

She

Robertson

The

For

Then
he

It

He

He
joined
up

brimful	JJ

The

He

A

The
wind
had
brought	VBD
several
trees
down

The
blast
brought	VB
a
large
part
of
the
wall
crashing

He
hooks
a
foot
round
the

They
were
responsible
for
bringing	VBG
jazz
to
Europe

...
the
unexpected
outcome
of
bringing	VBG
computers
into
schools
.

The
Executive
tried
to
bring	VB
the
sit-in
to
an
end
...

He
brought	VBG
the
car
to
a
stop
.

...
the
fight
to
bring	VB
down
inflation
...

Printing
brought	VB
the
cost
of
books
down
...

The
Equal
Pay
Act
has
failed
to
bring	VB

earnings
up

.

He
brought	VB
it
all
on
himself
.

This
generosity
brought	VB
applause
from
the
boys
...

His
performance
brought	VB
more
jeers
than
cheers
...

This
news
brought	VB
a
rebuke
from
Sir
Kenneth
.

The
wine
brought	VB
pink
spots
to
her
cheeks
...

The
biting
wind
brought	VB
tears
to
their
eyes
.

Winter
brought	VB
the
fogs
...

You
wonder
what
the
next
two
years
are
going

bring	VB
for
him
.

I
could
not
bring	VB
myself
to
touch
him
...

She
could
hardly
bring	VB
herself
to
go
...

One
wonders
how
they
ever
brought	VB
themselves
to
commit
this
grotesque
act
.

They
bring	VB
to
their
studies
a
sharpness
and
a
shrewdness
which
you
do
not
expect
in
an
18
year
old
.

This
brings	VBZ
me
to
the
work
of
the
day
centre
...

Man
will
find
a
way
of
making
use
of
them

which
brings	VBZ
us
to
the
question
of
just
what
that
use
could
be
.

This
programme
will
be
brought	VB
to
you

In

He

officials

...
a
list
of
criminal
charges
brought	VB
against

by
the

.

There
is
no
definite
evidence

could
be
brought	VB

Today
Remingtons

incredible

He

The

I
went

You
need
to
keep
the

at
a
brisk	JJ
pace
.

They
are
doing
a
brisk	JJ
trade
in

They
stopped
at
the
refreshment
tent
where
trade
was
gratifyingly
brisk	JJ
.

It
all
happened
one
brisk	JJ
April

The

What

But
all

They
will
be

British

The
youth
,
a
17-year-old
Briton

was
searched
and
arrested

The

dry

Why

There
was
a

tinkling

She
had
never

to
broach	VB
the

broached	VBD|VBN

Broad	VBD

Oh

Jenny
with

At

Ten
days
after
I
broadcast	VBD
this

I
had
a

Dont

As
the
stream
descends
it
broadens	VBZ

Her
smile
broadened	VBD|VBN
a
little
.

He
made
another
attempt
to
broaden	VB
his
appeal
.

He
wants
it
to
be
a
broadly-based	JJ
movement
.

She
assured
me
that
her
parents
were
broadminded	JJ

As
the
ship
came
close
and
turned
broadside	RB
,
we
saw
that
there
was
only
one
man
on
it
.

The
broadside	NN
which
landed
the
newspaper
in
trouble
was

accusation

had
deliberately

He
could
hardly
contain	VB
his
eagerness
to

The
news
was
so
exciting
that
Philip
could
hardly
contain	VB
himself
.

Hes
a
very
contained	JJ
man
.

The

Keep

a

which
seriously
contaminated	VBD|VBN
over
7000
square

It
is
exciting
to
contemplate	VB
how
many
new
ideas
are
lying
dormant
in
peoples
minds
...

He
sat
there
and
contemplated	VBD|VBN
.

Are
you
contemplating	VBG
marriage?
...

He
had
never
at
any
time
contemplated	VBD|VBN
selling
the
business
...

It
is
just
too
dangerous
to
contemplate	VB
.

She
lay
back
on
the

to
contemplate	VB
the

I
prefer
the

side
of
Sibelius

Darwins
contemporary	
,
Sir
James
Simpson
...

I
was
better
read
than
most
of
my
contemporaries	NNPS
.

He
was
warned
that
if
he
attempted
to
contact
me
hed
be
jailed
for
contempt	
of
court
...

Cliff
was
held
to
be
in
contempt	
of

.

You
are
showing
a
contemptible	JJ
lack
of
courage
.

His
lack
of
success
had
made
him
contemptuous	JJ
of
the
way
the
London
theatre
was
run
.

...
contemptuous	JJ
remarks

...
a
contemptuous	JJ
look
.

I
had
to
contend	VB
with
deep-rooted
prejudice
...

There
were
also
the
occasional
police
visits
to
contend	VB
with
.

Three
parties
are
contending	VBG
for
power
.

He
no
longer
saw
himself
as
a

in
the
Presidential
election
...

Who
are
the
main
contenders	NNS
for
the
title
?

A
few
were
content	JJ
to
pay
the
fines
...

It
seems
that
he
would
have
been
content	JJ
to
continue
for
a
long
time
...

She
is
not
content	JJ
with
these
explanations
.

However
hard
up
they
were
,
they
stayed
content	JJ
.

She
hadnt
said
much
but
had
contented	VBD|VBN
herself
with
smoking
cigarettes
and
smiling
...

I
contented	VBD|VBN
myself
with
the
use
of
words
.

Her
answer
seemed
to
content	VB
him
...

Perhaps
Im
too
easily
contented	VBD|VBN
.

Her
mouth
was
fixed
in
a
smile
of
pure
content	
.

My
father
was
the
most
contented	JJ
man
I
ever
met
...

They
smoked
for
a
while
,
contented	JJ
and
at
rest
.

It
is
my
contention	
that
demand
will
exceed
supply
within
the
next
five
years
...

My
main
contention	NN
is
that
the
project
would
be
too
expensive
.

He
is
well
known
for
his
contentious	JJ
views
on
mental
illness
.

You
appear
to
belong
to
a
contentious	JJ
family
.

We
entered
a
fishing
contest	VBD

...
a
beauty
contest	
.

He
won
the
contest	
for
the
deputy

There
is
always
a
contest	
between
the
management
and
the
unions
.

We
would
hotly
contest	VB
this
idea
...

I
am
going
to
contest	VB
the
will
.

They
may
both
be
future
contestants	NNS
for
the
Labour
leadership
.

We
need
to
place
present
events
in
some
kind
of
historical
context	VBZ
...

We
must
examine
these
ideas
in
the
context	
of
recent
events
...

He
always
provides
a
context	VBZ
that
makes
his
characters
believable
.

There
may
be
as
many
as
seven

contiguous	JJ

taste

contingent	
.

The

includes
a
contingent	
of
the
Foreign
Legion
...

There
was
still
one
British
contingent	
on
station
.

The
raid
was
contingent	JJ
on
the
weather
...

The
role
they
play
is
contingent	JJ
on
their
political
ability
and
zeal
.

It
was
sad
to
see
her
the
victim
of
continual	JJ
pain
...

Life
is
a
continual	JJ
struggle
.

He
still
smoked
,
despite
the
continual	JJ
warnings
of
his
nurse
.

...
the
continuation	
of
full
employment
.

We
saw
the
trip
as
a
natural
continuation	
of
the
tour
...

This
idea
is
really
a
continuation	
of
your
earlier
one
.

If
the
strike
continues	VBN
,
then
violence
is
inevitable
...

They
want
to
continue	VBN
their
education

...
the
continuing	VBG
conflict
in
Ireland

The

continued	VBD|VBN

an
hour

who
had
continued	VBD|VBN
their

The
next

continued	VBD|VBN

He
arrived
in
Norway

he
continued	VBD|VBN

Theyll
have
to
continue	VB
with
direct

Meanwhile
she
continues	VBZ
with

antibiotics
.

We
crossed
the
bridge
and
continued	VBD|VBN
towards
Villacoublay
...

She
left
the
village
and
continued	VBD|VBN
on
her
way
.

The
road
continues	VBG
to
the

.

Time
does
not
appear
to
him
as
a
continuous	JJ
,
uninterrupted
process
...

...
the
steady
and
continuous	JJ
increase
in
their
military
capacity
.

He
has
never
experienced
a
continuous	JJ

Good
and
evil
are
two
ends
of
the
same
continuum

...
the
left-right
political
continuum	
.

My
face
contorted	VBD|VBN
with
anguish
...

I
contorted	VBD|VBN
my
body
until
it
refused
to
respond
any
more
.

Their
bodily
contortions	NNS
are
an
inseparable
part

She
contradicts	VBZ
everything
I
say
.

There
is
a
mass
of
research
evidence
which
contradicts	VBZ
this
idea

All
our

Their

together

The

I
cannot
help
contrasting	VBG
her
attitude
with
that
of
her

His

contrasted	VBD|VBN
curiously
with

earthiness

These

two

The

I
set
about

The

The

be

Its
absurd
for

how

think
the

The

Eight

Over

in

found
they
could

The
decrease	
in

was
gradual

...
the
decrease	
in
the
bank
rate
from
7

5.5%.

It
was
a
life
of

The

What
do
you
deduce	VB

Tax

be

automatically

It
is
difficult
to
believe
,
yet
the
logic
of
the
deduction	
is
undeniable
.

Nearly

What

She
made
it
crystal
clear
in

If
you
do
your
good
deed	
for
the

you
do
something
to
help
someone

This
was
deemed	VBD|VBN
to

I
did
hope

She
took

The

The

He
waited
a
couple
of
hours
in
gradually
deepening	VBG
despair
,
then
gave
up

went

Their

The

The

deepened	VBD|VBN
from

a

He
pointed

He

his

He

These

I
was

The

you

They
were

Youre
defending	VBG

It

McGuigan
defended	VBD|VBN
his

He
decided
on
a

Muhammad
Ali
rather
than
defending	VBD

She
was
faced
with
the
difficult
task

pleading

obviously
guilty

It
was
unclear
who
the
light
really
favoured

attackers

defenders	VB
.

The
most
morally
defensible	JJ
distribution
system
is
one
based

These

are
only
aimed

limiting

We
hope

The

obvious
to
everybody

Many

a

To
defile	VB

therefore
the
gravest
form

Is
it
your

drink

under
the
delusion	
that

had
somehow
become
immune

Was
this
a
delusion

persecution

the
heady

delusive	JJ
scent

Cathy

it

What

He

It

He
resisted

that

The
problem
is
that
the

Acting

a

was
considered
socially
demeaning	VBD

The
man
was
polite

his
general
demeanour	
had
the
air

demystify	VB

made

The

a
clear
reflection

the
position

His
denials	NNS
were
once
more
believed

They
protested
against
the
continued
denial

To
assert

is
to
denigrate	VB

The
orchestra
fell
silent
as
the
oil
lamp
dimmed	VBD|VBN

the
curtain
rose
.

The
elation
of
the
brothers
could
not
be
dimmed	VBD|VBN
...

These
hopes
were
somewhat
dimmed	VBD|VBN
by
the
results
of
the
party
conference
.

Even
the
policemans
eyes
were
momentarily
dimmed	VBD
with
tears
.

Even
after
sixty
years
,
his
memories
of
the
war
had
not
dimmed	VBD|VBN
.

Most
of
us
were
Catholic
,
and
this
added
an
extra
dimension	
to
the
tension

There
are
international
dimensions	NNS
to
our
problems
in
Britain
.

a
growing
awareness

the
true
dimensions	NNS
of
the
threat

The
dimensions	NNS
of
the
problems

seemed
unimportant

comparison

Many
of
these

grew
to
magnificent

The
critics
considered
only
the
undesirable
qualities

the
artists
work
,
while
ignoring
or
at
best
diminishing	VBG
the
more
desirable
ones

I
felt
very
considerably
diminished	VB
,
a
complete
and
utter
idiot

She

that

They
arrived

We

The

I
dined	VBD|VBN
with
the
President

a
dozen

There
was
a
bit

ding-dong

The

This
is
a
fundamental
question

which
we
should
all
be
directing	VBG

attention

Defence

I
thought
her
words

Can
you

The

Mr
Adrian
Oliver

director

said
yesterday
that
work
was
progressing
well

He
became
artistic
director	
of
the
Sadlers
Wells
ballet
in
1978
.

She
was
the
newest

He
had
a

...
the
first
meeting

Ten

held

We
have
lots

dirt-cheap	JJ
pieces

He
wiped
his
face
with
a
dirty	JJ
arm

Use
a
damp
sponge
to
remove
dirty	JJ

He
claimed
he
was
asked
to
do
a
dirty	JJ
job

They
even
played

dirty	JJ
trick

two
.

Shes
always
cheerful

The

She
has

The
disabled	NNS
is
used

refer
to
people
who

There
are
some
extraordinary
chairs
for
the

nowadays
.

Well
,
I
think
I
can
disabuse	VB
you
of
that
notion
,
he
said
solemnly
.

This
inability
was
obviously
an
enormous
disadvantage	
...

The
disadvantage	
of
this
plan
was
that
it
needed
more
people
.

...
disadvantaged	JJ
children
...

...
disadvantaged	JJ
sections
of
the
community
.

These
factors
made
the
1976
agreement
disadvantageous	JJ
to
the
British
.

The
party
won
a
by-election
,
then
gained
four
disaffected	JJ
UP
members
.

Benn
disagreed	VBD|VBN
with
the
abandonment

Oranges

disagree	VB

encounter

Mrs
Baggot

tests
which
are
disagreeable	JJ
,
humiliating
,

agonizing

There
were
some
disagreeable	VBD
people
around
,
it
was
true
...

Stop
being
so
disagreeable	JJ
!

They
are
divided
by
disagreements	NNS
about
specific
points
of
policy
...

I
guess
you
could
call
it
a
family
disagreement	
...

I
cant
recall
that
we
ever
had
a
serious
disagreement	
about
business
.

The
appeals
were
disallowed	VBD|VBN
by
the
electoral
court
.

I
saw
him
disappear	VB
round
the
corner
...

She
disappeared	VBD|VBN
down
the
corridor
...

Diana
disappeared	VBD|VBN
to
heat
the
soup
.

I
used
to
disappear	VB
for
hours
up
high
trees
...

In
short
I
shall
disappear	VB
.
You
will
hear
nothing
from
me
again
.

Some
newspapers
are
going
to
disappear	VB
as
a
result
of
this
strike
...

His
approval
can
disappear	VBD
as
fast
as
it
appears
...

After
all
,
it
was
only
the
dinosaurs
that
disappeared	VBD|VBN
,
not
the
whole
of
animal
life
.

No
one
would
enquire
too
closely
into
the
disappearance	
of
such
an
unimportant
person
.

He
mentioned
the
disappearance	
of
his
passport
to
the
manager
.

This
could
lead
to
their
total
disappearance	
within
fifty
or
sixty
years
.

The
answer
must
have
disappointed	VBD|VBN
him
...

You
disappoint	VB
me
:
I
had
expected
you
to
behave
more
responsibly
.

I
could
not
help
suspecting
that
it
would
disappoint	VB
Thomass
expectations
of
an
inheritance
.

He
was
disappointed	JJ
that
the
other
side
had
won
...

He
died
a
disappointed	JJ
man
...

I
was
disappointed	JJ
to
learn
that
the
fee
would
be
only
fifteen
pounds
.

The
results
have
generally
been
disappointing	JJ
...

They
have
been
somewhat
disillusioned
by
the
disappointing	JJ
progress
of
the
EEC
.

He
said
it
was
a
disappointment	
,
but
not
a
disaster
...

This
may
prove
a
disappointment	NN
to
the
party
.

Clarissa
gave
a
snort
of
disapproval	
...

He
has
never
disguised
his
disapproval	
of
the
President
.

The
other
directors
disapproved	VBD|VBN
of
his
methods
...

Why
cant
I
smoke?Because
I
disapprove	VB
,
thats
why
.

...
a
group
of
women
with
disapproving	JJ
expressions
.

They
set
out
to
disarm	VB
the
various
terrorist
groups
.

He
argues
that
if
we
unilaterally
disarm	VB
then
they
will
do
likewise
.

Perhaps
it
was
the
French
accent
that
disarmed	VBD|VBN
her
.

Like
orthodox
Christianity
,
it
can
disarm	VB
all
criticism
by
reference
to
its
own
holy
writings
.

There
was
a
disarming	JJ
air
of
informality
.

Already
she
could
feel
the
wind
disarranging	VBG
her
hair
.

It
was
the
latest
in
a
string
of
hotel
disasters	NNS
...

She
was
in
Mexico
City
when
the
disaster	VBD
happened
...

The
city
suffered
the
worst
US
air
disaster	
since
1979
.

Now
he
must
come
to
grips
with
the
disaster	
that
is
the
national
economy
...

His
last
day
at
work
was
a
disaster	
...

This
governments
policy
on
education
is
an
unmitigated
disaster	NN
.

In
1974
famine
came
in
the
wake
of
disastrous	JJ
floods
.

He
made
a
disastrous	JJ
attempt
to
direct
Antony
and
Cleopatra
.

He
had
refused
to
disavow	VB
his
attitudes
on
human
rights
.

After
twenty
years
the
organization
was
disbanded	VBD|VBN
...

They
began
to
disband	VBN
.

There
is
no
reason
to
disbelieve	VB
him
...

I
never
disbelieved	VBD|VBN
their
story
.

I
have
always
disbelieved	VBD|VBN
in
telepathy

Can
you
disbelieve	VB
in
something
you
dont
know
about
?

During
1974
,
213m
was
disbursed	VBD|VBN
in
regional
development

I
had
slipped
a
disc

One
third
of
the
spine

made
up
of
these
discs	NNS
.

They
regularly
bought
one
or
more
discs	NNS
every
week

Should
they
discard	VB
the
present
system
entirely?
...

They
ate
food
discarded	VBD|VBN
by
the
soldiers

He
is
unable
to
discern	VB
what
is

Any
further
increase

a
disincentive

I
was
disinclined	JJ
to
say
anything
to
anybody

Let
me
wash
those
cuts
and
disinfect	VB
them

Her

As
a
minority
group
,
they
remain
trapped
,
disinherited	JJ

despised
.

They
had
seen
their
marriages

disintegrate	VBD
under
its
influence
...

All
around
me
,
I
could
feel
morale
disintegrating	VBN
.

Both
ships
simply
seemed
to
disintegrate	VB
...

The
bird
disintegrated	VBD|VBN
into
a
few
pathetic
feathers
.

An
entertaining
historical
play
was
disinterred	VBD|VBN

The

the
Governments
fundamental
disinterest	
in

...
compassionate

disinterested	JJ
groups

So
you
can
see
Im
a
disinterested	JJ
observer
.

Her
mother
had
always
been
disinterested	JJ
in
her
.

She
disliked	VBD|VBN
the
theatre

I
grew
to
dislike	VB
working
for
the
cinema

From
what
I
know
of
him
I
dislike	VB
him
intensely
.

She
has
her
likes

dislikes	NNS
,
as
we
all
have
.

My
hip
felt
as
if
I
had
dislocated	VBD|VBN
it
.

The
whole
thing
was
dislocated	VBD|VBN
by
the
sudden
computer
failure
.

I
had
to
tug
quite
hard
in
order
to
dislodge	VB
the
hook
...

I
might
have
dislodged	VBD|VBN
the
earth

I
moved

You
were
disloyal	JJ

They

Hunter

rather
dismal	JJ
melody
.

They
are
so
constructed
that
they
may
be
dismantled	VBD|VBN
if
necessary
.

Theyve
been
accused

dismantling	VBD

I
was
homesick
and
dismayed	VBD|VBN
by
the
quiet

Last

he
dismayed	VBD|VBN

You
can
dismember	VB
an
animal
as
large

a
cow

that
.

Nor
was
England
about
to
dismember	VB
the
empire
of
the
previous
king
.

The
problems
can
no
longer
be
dismissed	VBD|VBN
...

Im
not
dismissing	VBG
this
as
a
thing
that
wasnt
worth
doing
...

We
shouldnt
dismiss	VB
them
just
because
theyre
old-fashioned
.

And
then
as
suddenly
as
the
idea
had
risen
,
he
dismissed	VBD|VBN
it
...

She
dismissed	VBD|VBN
him
from
her
mind
.

An
individual
cannot
now
be
dismissed	VBD|VBN
for
non-membership
of
a
union
.

Smollett
asked

the

Her
lawyer
asked
to
have

.

You
seemed
dismissive	JJ
of
him
,
too
.

The
police
officer
dismounted	VBD|VBN
from
his
bicycle
.

Peter
was
disobedient	JJ
to
his
parents
...

She
wore
the
air
of
a
disobedient	JJ
child
.

It
never
occurred
to
them
that
they
could
disobey	VB
their
parents
...

I
moaned
all
the
time
about
it
,
but
I
could
not
disobey	VB
...

His
orders
had
been
disobeyed	VBD|VBN
.

He
had
a
somewhat
spiteful
and
disobliging	VBZ
nature
.

...
a
renewal
of
civil
disorders	VB
in
several
cities
.

There
was
evidence
of
a
kidney
disorder	
...

...
a
specialist
in
various
forms
of
mental
disorders	NNS
.

There
were
too
many
things
in
the
small
disordered	JJ
room
.

More
training
in
the
care
of
mentally
disordered	JJ
patients
was
needed
.

They
go
upstairs
to
their
disorderly	JJ
bedroom
...

Her
belongings
now
lie
scattered
once
again
in
a
disorderly	JJ
mess
.

The
police
attempted
to
disperse
the
disorderly	JJ
crowd
.

Im
too
busy
.
Youll
disorganize	VB
my
whole
morning
schedule
.

It
was
a
bit
disorganized	JJ
,
but
there
were
one
or
two
very
fine
scenes
.

Her
father
disowned	VBD|VBN
and
disinherited
her
.

Other
newspapers
in
the
country
tended
to
disparage	VB
this
as
weak
liberalism
.

He
had
been
making
disparaging	JJ
remarks
about
Ottos
talents
.

...
a
link
between
these
very
disparate	VBD
aspects
of
scientific
research
...

The
level
of
talent
seems
so
disparate	JJ
.

The
disparity	
in
inflation
rates
in
1976
caused
many
problems
...

They
aim
to
reduce
economic
disparities	NNS
between
the
rich
and
poor
countries
.

The
dispassionate	JJ
observer
can
only
be
puzzled
by
this
phenomenon
.

The
supervisor
would
dispatch	VB
a
crew
to
repair
the
damage
...

The
cruiser
despatched
boats
to
rescue
the
survivors
...

My
sister
was
dispatched	VBD|VBN
to
our
grandmother
in
Scotland
.

The
emergency
required
the
dispatch	
of
special
forces
.

I
picked
up
the
paper
and
read
a
dispatch	
from
a
correspondent
in
Delhi
.

We
were
bringing
dispatches	NNS
from
Captain
Sydney
Smith
.

Im
sorry
to
have
to
dispel	VB
your
romantic
notions
...

All
such
doubts
were
now
dispelled	VBD|VBN
.

I
have
had
a
special
dispensation	
...

You
dont
even
have
to
obtain
a
dispensation	
.

They
are
better
off
under
the
new
dispensation	
.

The
charity
has
been
given
a
large
sum
of
money
to
dispense	VB
as
it
sees
fit
.

The
firm
has
been
dispensing	VBG
ointments
and
lotions
for
generations
...

...
a
dispensing	VBG
chemist
.

The
people
in
charge
of
health
and
welfare
had
ceased
to
dispense	VB
either
.

By
now
,
most
of
the
pieces
had
dispersed	VBD|VBN
on
the
tide
...

Building
tall
chimneys
to
disperse	VBD
the
smoke
is
no
solution
at
all
.

I
had
seen
many
crowds
dispersed	VB
by
policemen
...

The
foot
soldiers
rapidly
dispersed	VBD|VBN
and
vanished
into
the
woods
.

She
sounded
genuinely
dispirited	JJ
...

The
Party
is
dispirited	JJ
and
divided
.

...
the
first
dismal
,
dispiriting	JJ
day
of
November
.

These
resources
can
quickly
displace	VB
nuclear
power
...

I
think
this
Government
is
going
to
be
displaced	VBD|VBN
sooner
than
that
.

This
family
has
been
displaced	VBD|VBN
three
times
by
urban
demolition
.

There
were
cakes
displayed	VBD|VBN
in
the
front
window
...

...
a
small
museum
where
they
could

His
attention
was
caught
by
the
photographs
displayed	VBD|VBN
outside
.

The
new
models
are
on
display	
in
gas
showrooms
...

It
was
possible
to
have
these
photographs
for
display	
.

He
thrust
his
chest
out
,
displaying	VBG
his
organisers
badge
.

His
article
had
displayed	VBD|VBN
a
positive
attitude
to
public
ownership
...

As
usual
he
was
trying
to
display	VBD
his
concern
about
pollution

...
a
spontaneous
display	
of
friendship
and
affection
...

In
a
brief
display	
of
courtesy
,
he
offered
her
his
seat
.

The
computer
will
not
only
display	VB
the
text
,
but
speak
it
.

A
display	
of
paperbacks
was
spread
out
on
the
pavement
.

...
a
firework
display	
...

This
is
one
of
fifty
such
displays	NNS
being
mounted
over
the
next
few
days
.

Each
number
would
appear
on
the
display	
.

He
could
hurt
me
very
badly
if
I
displeased	VBD|VBN
him
.

Don
seemed
displeased	JJ
...

She
didnt
sound
displeased	JJ
.

Smith
has
become
displeased	JJ
with
some
members
of
the
staff
.

None
of
them
actually
dared
to
voice
their
displeasure	
...

His
policy
was
to
minimize
every
risk
of
incurring
her
displeasure	
.

They
could
be
seen
disporting	VBG
themselves
in
the
fashionable
discotheques
.

a

More

Real

rise

Neither
country

escalate
their
quarrel
any
further
.

The
Queen
is
favourably
disposed	JJ
to
your
plea

The
paper
was
well
disposed	JJ
towards

.

The
choir
was
disposed	JJ
in
the
most
original
way
,
with
half
the
singers
at
the
back
of
the
hall
.

My
boss
was
of
an
exceptionally
nervous
disposition	
...

...
a
natural
disposition	
to
feelings
of
panic
.

There
was
no
apparent
disposition	
to
recognize
the
grim
facts
of

...

Dixon
had
been
showing
a
disposition	
to
tremble

You
had
best
discuss
with
her
the
disposition	
of
the
furniture
...

...
the
disposition	
of
the
rooms
.

She
and
her
husband

be
dispossessed	VBD|VBN

the
house

left
destitute
.

...
the
disproportion	VBP
between

political
developments

The
job
seemed
to
take
a
disproportionate	JJ
amount

time
.

They
can
neither
prove
nor
disprove	VB
that
it
is
genuine
.

...
endless
meetings
,
disputations	VBD

clashes

Industrial
disputes	NNS
are
still
a
problem
...

The

has
promised

provide
support

The

lived
happily
together

An
old

resurfaced

Officials

disputed	VBD|VBN

I

Three

He
is
liable

disqualification	NN
from
all

The
intensity

his
anger
disquieted	VBD|VBN
me
.

This
is
no
place
to
enter
into
a
lengthy
disquisition	
on

We
are
not

We
disregarded	VBD|VBN

Senator
Watt

Keep
away

Ash

his
disreputable	JJ

I
lived
a
somewhat
disreputable	VBD
life

I
dont

Citizens

As

The

has
left
everybody
dissatisfied	JJ

There

Each

The

Every

I
dissent	VB
from
the
idea

We
spend

I
think
George

Our

not

Their

the
people
of
Wales

Americans

over
this

...

Beliefs
run
very
deep
and
religion
can
either
unite
or
divide	VBD
.

The
divide	
between
rich
and
poor
was
great
.

The
invention

My

Public

Many

The

Open

The

At

is
created
in
the
Divine	JJ
Image
...

These
men
had
all
been
operating
under
divine	JJ
inspiration
.

No
watcher
could
have
divined	VBD|VBN
that
the
quiet
English
tourist
was
really
an
assassin
...

She

Isnt

...

Perhaps
,
after
all
,
they
have
found
a
divinity	
to
worship
.

Each
of
these
numbers
is
divisible	JJ
by
two
.

When
the
atom
was
found
to
be
divisible	VBN
it
seemed
that
it
might
have
an
indivisible
core
.

Theres

considerable
division

The

passed
it
without
division	
,
after
a
generally
harmonious
debate
.

The
two-tier
school
system
was
seen
as
divisive	JJ
by
many

Though

The
prisoners
were
grateful

docile	JJ
.

The
ship
entered
the
dock	
to
a
fanfare
of
trumpets
.

He
went
to
the
London
Docks	VB
and
spent
two
days
trying
to
get
a
job
...

During
the
war
women
worked
on
the
farms
,
on
the
docks	NNS
and
in
the
factories
...

Much
of
the
vast
dock	
area
in
Glasgow
has
been
closed
.

It
was
raining
the
morning
they
docked	VBD|VBN
at
Southampton
...

I
sailed
slowly
because
I
didnt
want
to
dock	VB
my
boat
in
the
dark
.

He
explained
from
the
dock	
why
he
thought
his
parents
should
die
...

He
thought
about
the
other
people
who
should
have
been
in
the
dock	
at
his
side
.

His
wages
were
docked	VBD|VBN
to
pay
for
the
equipment
he
had
broken
...

She
lent
her
daughter
5
pounds
and
then
docked	VBD|VBN
her
pocket
money
until
the
debt
was
paid
off
.

He
drew
attention
to
the
rising
unemployment
among
dockers	NNS
.

He
stuffed
the
docket	
for
the
second
case
into
his
back
pocket
.

They
had
been
examined

docketed	VBD|VBN

He
lived

worked
in
the
Liverpool
dockland

She
felt
so
ill
we
had
to
call
the
doctor	
...

I
went
to
see
Doctor	
Barker
this
morning
.

The
doctors	NNS
is
used
to
refer
to
the
surgery

clinic
where
a
doctor	
works
.

He
is
a
doctor	
of
philosophy
.

Im
sure
hes
doctored	VBD|VBN
the
figures
...

We
all
realized
the
play
needed
a
certain
amount
of
doctoring	VBG
.

...
Dr
Edwards
,
a
painter
with
a
doctorate	VBD
in
art
,
psychology
and
education
.

Their
attitudes
were
condemned
as
doctrinaire	VBZ
.

In
Britain
we
have
this
very
well-established
doctrine	NN
of
parliament
being
sovereign
...

...
his
ignorance
of
Christian
doctrine	
...

Their
doctrines	NNS
led
them
to
believe
in
their
own
moral
supremacy
.

He
studied
some
official
documents	NNS
relating
to
the
nineteenth
century
...

He
was
issued
with
travel
documents	NNS
which
allowed
him
to
fly
back
to
the
United
States

They
made
a
documentary	
about
the
life

William
Shakespeare

She
was
doddering	JJ

He
was
scrambling
to
his
feet
,
dodging	VBN
and
ducking
to
escape
more
blows
...

He
stopped
the
car
and
dodged	VBD|VBN
into
the
post
office
.

...
with
a
quick
dodge	
to
the
right
.

The
Minister
had
to
dodge	VB
flying
tomatoes
.

This
issue
should
not
be
dodged	VBD|VBN
...

We
cannot
dodge	VB
this
accusation
.

Hes
been
trying
to
dodge	VB
going
to
school
by
pretending
to
be
ill
.

He
had
tried
all
sorts
of
dodges	NNS
to
avoid
being
called
up
.

Lets
go
on
the
dodgems	NNS
.

He
was
accused
of
being
a
tax
dodger	
.

Theres
something
dodgy	JJ
about
him
.

Its
a
rather
dodgy	JJ
plan
.

She
was
made
to
feel
like
an
inarticulate
dodo	VBZ
.

She
is
one
of
the
doers	NNS
of
this

Their
dog	NN
started
barking
at

He

her
down

the
dirty
dog	
.

Hes
been
dogging	VBG
me
all
day
.

Bad
luck
had
dogged	VBD|VBN
me
all
year
...

The
tour
was
dogged	VBD|VBN
by
injury
and
loss
of
confidence
.

He
had
no
time
for
political
or
other
dogmas	NNS
...

...
Christianity
in
the
early
days
when
there
was
less
dogma	
.

He
was
so
dogmatic	JJ
about
it
that
I
almost
believed
what
he
was
saying
...

His
friends
were
all
intensely
dogmatic	JJ
political
theoreticians
...

She
was
not
impressed
by
his
dogmatic	JJ
assertions
.

He
was
employed
as
a
general
dogsbody	
on
the
project
.

I
was
dog-tired	JJ
that
evening
.

He
gave
an
admiring
account
of
Larrys
doings	VB
.

How
much
is
the
dole	
now
,
20

...

There
was
no
dole	VBD
for
farm
labourers
.

Things
are
getting
desperate
,
he
said
in
a
doleful	JJ
monotone
.

his
rapid
transformation
from

He
was

busy
chasing
the
teenage
dollies	NNS
of

.

You
would
have
to
be
a
complete
dolt	
to
miss
the
turn-off
.

This
question
comes
into
the
domain	
of
philosophy
...

The
ultimate
responsibility
in
this
domain	NN
,
as
in
all
others

lay
with
the

Everything
sounded
very
peaceful

He
was
not
prepared

sacrifice
this
principle
in
the
interests

She

domestic	JJ
sort

Should
the
women
quit
their
jobs

become
domestics	NNS
?

Our

domesticated	VBD|VBN
various
plant

species
.

She
took
me
to
what
was
apparently
her
own
domicile	
.

She
is
regarded
as
domiciled	JJ
in
the
UK
.

The
treaty
gave
them
dominance	
of
the
sea
routes
...

It
was
to
be
even
longer
before
their
dominance	
over
the
party
was
eroded
.

Agriculture
,
the
original
basis
of
civilization
,
has
lost
its
dominance	
in
nation
after
nation
...

...
the
dominance	
of
economics
among
the
social
sciences
.

Chapter

examines
the
dominant	VBP
feature
of

...

...
the
television
experts
who
play
a
dominant	JJ
role
in
moulding
public
opinion
...

As
long
as
the
need
for
food
,
clothing
and
shelter
is
dominant	JJ
they
will
continue
to
work
.

She
is
the
dominant	JJ
partner
in
their
marriage
.

These
issues
dominated	VBD|VBN
the
election
...

That
sort
of
job
doesnt
dominate	VB
your
whole
existence
for
twenty-four
hours
a
day
.

This
nation
,
with
its
great
armies
,
seemed
likely
to
dominate	VB
the
whole
of
Western
Europe
.

The
older
women
were
not
permitted
to
dominate	VB
the
younger
male
members
of
the
family
.

The
valley
was
dominated	VBD|VBN
by
the
huge
Benedictine
abbey
.

He
was
a
rather
aggressive
and
dominating	JJ
character
.

Many
of
her
women
friends
also
had
domineering	JJ
husbands
.

...
a
Dominican	VBP
monk
...

At
the
Dominican	JJ
Church
I
joined
the
line
and
filed
inside
.

...
the
great
imperial
dominions	NNS
of
the
nineteenth
century
.

They
played
dominoes	NNS
all
night
.

The
other
two
men
donned	VBD|VBN
white
cotton
gloves
.

...
a
don	
at
the
Ankara
faculty
of
political
science
.

The
van
was
donated	VBD|VBN
to
us
by
a
local
firm
...

It
seemed
unfair
to
ask
my
family
to
donate	VB
money
to
such
a
project
.

They
received
a
large
donation	
from
one
of
the
unions
...

He
made
a
generous
donation	
to
our
campaign
fund
...

The
rest
of
the
money
we
get
from
donations	NNS
.

Much
was
made
of
the
donation	
of
this
sum
of
money
.

When
her
errand
was
done	JJ
she
ran
home
.

I
hope
youre
not
too
donnish	JJ
,
Tom
.

It
seemed
that
he
might
look
forward
to
a
donnish	JJ
life
devoted
to
private
study
.

There
is
still
a
shortage
of
kidney
donors	NNS
...

...
a
blood
donor	
scheme
.

About
half
this
amount
comes
from
individual
donors	NNS
and
bequests
.

Pass
me
the
doodah	
will
you
?

He
made
a
few
doodles	NNS
with
a
ballpoint
on
the
back
of
the
bill
.

I
used
to
doodle	VBD
on
my
papers
.

What
doomed	VBD|VBN
him
was
the
verdict
of
guilty
...

He
was
doomed	VBD|VBN
to
unemployment
by
his
ill-health
.

We
are
,
most
of
us
,
doomed	JJ
to
unhappiness
...

He
was
doomed	JJ
to
be
killed
in
a
car
crash
.

They
informed
the
Prime
Minister
that
his
government
was
doomed	JJ
...

He
was
a
propeller
maker
.
Now
that
is
a
doomed	JJ
trade
if
ever
there
was
one
.

As
they
passed
through
the
door	
,
they
saw
Tom
at
the
end
of
the
room
.

Ill
meet
you
outside
the
main
door	
at
ten
oclock
...

A
crowd
had
gathered
at
the
door	
.

Ever
since
then
youve
treated
me
like
a
doormat	NN
.

A
child
stood
in
the
doorway	
.

...
twelve
year
old
dope	
addicts
...

...
streets
free
of
crime
and
dope	
peddling
.

...
enough
dope	NN
to
knock
the
average
man
unconscious
.

We
got
the
dope	NN
on
the
latest
offer
from
Morgan
.

They
discovered
that
the
horse
had
been
doped	VBD|VBN
.

He
doped	VBD|VBN
her
drink
...

She
had
been
doped	VBD|VBN
and
kidnapped
.

The
girls
were
doped	VBD|VBN
to
the
eyeballs
...

They
are
all
so
doped	VBD|VBN
up
they
wouldnt
know
a
war
had
started
.

This
is
what
the
guy
means
,
isnt
it
,
you
dope	
...

What
did
that
dumb
dope	
mean
saying
it
was
nothing
important
?

Luckily
for
Louisa
she
just
felt
dopey	JJ
when
she
woke
up
the
next
morning
...

They
were
still
too
dopey	JJ
to
take
any
notice
of
us
.

Shes
all
right
,
but
her
brothers
a
bit
dopey	JJ
.

I
lay
in
bed
in
the
dormitory	VB
crying
under
the
sheet
.

Basingstoke
is
trying
to
get

25
mg

with
a
maximum

dosage	VB
of
150
mg
.

She
refused
her
daily
dose	VBG
of
medicine
...

This
is
lethal
to
rats
in
small
doses	NNS
.

Newspapers
dispensed
large
doses	NNS
of
nationalism
to
their
readers
during
the
war
.

Of
course
he
drank
,
and
he
dosed	VBD|VBN
himself
with
pills
...

Feverish
patients
were
dosed	VBD|VBN
with
quinine
.

All
records
of
all
meetings

files
,
and
dossiers	NNS
must
be
destroyed

We
have
a
hefty
dossier	NN
on
his
exploits
in
the
war
.

Beneath
the
smoke
was
a
dot	
that
might
have
been
a
ship
...

A
dot	
of
light
glowed
on
the
roof
.

Countless
fishing
villages
dot	VB
the
coast
.

The
Duchess
of
Marlborough
doted	VBD
on
him
.

The
old
girl
is
slightly
dotty	JJ
...

She
really
could
be
very
dotty	JJ
sometimes
.

Her
uncle
was
still
dotty	VBD
about
roses
.

I
ordered
a
double	JJ
vodka
and
orange
.

A
bottle
of
whisky
was
produced
and
three
doubles	VBD
were
poured
.

The
world
population
is
doubling	VBG
every
thirty-five
years
...

The
average
baby
doubles	VBZ
its
birth
weight
at
about
five
months
.

She
doubled	VBD|VBN
the
blanket
before
putting
it
on
the
bed
.

My
first
job
was
as
Sophia
Lorens
double	
in
an
air-crash
scene
.

I
saw
your
double	NN
in
the
street
last
night
.

Her
secretary
doubled	VBD|VBN
as
her
housekeeper
...

This
bedroom
doubles	VBZ
as
a
study
.

The
tiny
animal
doubles	VBZ
,
stops
,
and
then
finally
runs
back
.

She
double-checked	VBD|VBN
her
bag
to
make
sure
shed
got
everything
.

In
spite
of
all
his
double-checks	NNS
,
he
hadnt
noticed
that
the
door
wasnt
locked
.

You
want
me
to
double-cross	VB
the
man
I
work
for
?

I
suddenly
realized
that
it
was
a
double-cross	VBZ
.

She
made
a
very
double-edged	JJ
remark
about
my
work
.

Is
it
really
worth
double-glazing	VBG
your
house
?

The
police
arrived
double-quick	RB
,
and
arrested
him
...

They
had
the
rest
of
us
locked
up
in
double-quick	RB
time
.

We
were
doubly	RB
disappointed
that
Jane
didnt
come
either
...

They
were
doubly	RB
confident
after
this
that
he
would
win
.

He
is
doubly	RB
disadvantaged
,
both
by
his
age
and
his
nationality
...

When
inflation
is
accompanied
by
unemployment
,
this
is
doubly	RB
true
.

As
I
drove
to
East
London
I
had
moments
of
doubt	VBD
that
I
was
doing
the
right
thing
.

They
inwardly
doubted	VBD|VBN
the
facts
...

Some
of
our
members
doubt	VB
the
value
of
demonstrations
...

He
had
the
courage
to
doubt	VB
,
where
all
the
others
piously
believed
.

Why
should
I
doubt	VB
him?
...

I
apologized
for
having
doubted	VBD|VBN
his
word
.

The
organisation
has
a
doubtful	JJ
future
...

How
long
this
would
continue
into
the
future
was
doubtful	JJ

It
is
doubtful	VBD
,
however
,
whether
the
Chairman
would
approve
.

She
is

I
was
a
little
doubtful	JJ
about

He
was
doubtful	JJ
that
he
could
ever
manage
it
...

Segal
is
doubtful	JJ
whether
were
meant
to
take
all
this
very
seriously
.

The
old

took
up
the
doughy	JJ
mass

placed
it
upon

hot
stone

it
was
with

dour	JJ
expression
.

Yes

said
Christopher
,
smiling
dourly	RB

He
doused	VBD|VBN
the
lamp
,
and
we
made
our
way
back

His

had
been
doused	VBD|VBN

water

She
had
doused	VBD|VBN
herself
with

There
were
white

The

,
Dick
,
and
Jamieson
.

We
went
into
the
drab	JJ
old
building
...

Life
was
now
drab	JJ
compared
with
the
more
exciting
life
style
overseas
.

He
showed
me
the
draft	NN
of
an
article
he
was
writing
...

...
the
change
from
the
first
draft	
to
the
final
printed
version
.

They
sat
down
and
drafted	VBD|VBN
a
letter
to
the
local
newspaper
...

The
President
drafted	VBD|VBN
a
bill
which
he
presented
to
Congress
.

He
left
America
so
that
he
could
avoid
the
draft	NN
...

He
received
his
draft	
card
three
months
after
he
left
school
.

I
was
drafted	VBD|VBN
into
the
navy
...

He
took
a
temporary
job
while
he
was
waiting
to
be
drafted	VBD|VBN
.

Extra
staff
were
drafted	VBD|VBN
from
Paris
to
Rome
to
arrange
the
Presidents
visit
...

He
hoped
to
draft	VB
in
a
force
of
20,000
guerrillas
to
help
overthrow
the
government
.

I
arranged
for
a
draft	NN
for
500
to
be
available
in
Rome
...

I
was
paid
by
draft	
...

...
cheques
,
bankers
drafts	NNS
,
or
letters
of
credit
.

He
watched
her
drag	VB
a
chair
across
the
room
to
join
them
...

He
listened
as
the
body
was
dragged	VBZ
up
the
stairs
.

He
grabbed
her
and
dragged	VBD|VBN
her
away
...

They
overturned
a
car
and
dragged	VBD|VBN
out
the
driver
...

A
lot
of
the
plants
had
been
dragged	VBD|VBN
up
by
the
roots
.

Im
sorry
to
drag	VB
you
to
the
telephone
,
but
something
awful
has
happened
.

He
moved
slowly
,
dragging	VBG
his
sore
foot
...

The
bird
tried
to
get
him
away
from
her
nest
by
dragging	VBG
a
wing
as
if
it
had
been
injured
.

I
was
able
to
use
the
table
to
drag	VB
myself
shakily
to
my
feet
...

Even
though
she
felt
ill
,
she
managed
to
drag	VBN
herself
down
to
the
shops
.

Jack
dragged	VBD|VBN
his
eyes
away
from
the
girl
...

They
could
not
drag	VB
themselves
away
from
the
party
.

The
part
of
the
play
which
drags	VBZ
is
the
last
half-hour
...

The
day
was
dragging	VBG
,
and
I
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
night
would
ever
come
.

I
told
her
I
was
leaving
because
I
didnt
want
the
police
dragging	VBG
the
river
for
my
body
.

She
feels
that
her
children
have
been
a
real
drag	
on
her
career
.

She
thought
that
wearing
school
uniform
was
a
real
drag	
...

It
was
a
drag	NN
to
drive
30
kilometres
to
work
every
day
.

He
smiled
and
took
a
drag	
on
his
pipe
.

It
is
important
to
drain	VB
the
wound
.

All
the
sewage
drains	VBZ
off
into
the
river
...

The
seas
drained	VBD|VBN
away
and
the
sea
bed
became
dry
...

These
veins
drain	VB
the
blood
from
the
brain
.

Put
those
plates
on
the
rack
to
drain	VB
.

It
was
marsh
once
,
drained	VBD|VBN
by
Henry
VIII
for
a
deer
park
...

The
clay
was
drained	VBD|VBN
and
much
of
it
turned
into
bricks
.

Mary
picked
up
the
glass
and
drained	VBD|VBN
it
...

He
drained	VBG
what
was
left
of
his
drink
.

Slowly
the
red
drained	VBD|VBN
from
Jacks
cheeks
.

He
felt
the
tension
drain	VB
out
of
him
...

Gradually
he
feels
his
reluctance
draining	VBG
away
.

The
project
is
already
draining	VBG
the
charitys
funds
.

This
kind
of
work
drains	VBZ
you
.

The
banks
suddenly
are
facing
a
very
large
drain	
on
their
funds
...

...
a
heavy
drain	
on
military
manpower
.

He
dropped
the
keys
down
a
large
drain	VBD
set
into
the
pavement
.

There
were
several
broken
and
leaking
drainpipes	NNS
and
gutters
.

Would
you
care
for
a
dram	
?

I
remember
her
acting
in
a
drama	
called
The
Garden
Party
.

...
drama	
,
music
,
and
painting
...

...
an
expert
on
modern
poetic
drama	
.

She
went
in
for
drama	
...

She
enjoyed
two
years
at
drama	NN
school
.

I
expect
to
see
dramatic	JJ
improvements
.

Look
!
she
said
,
flinging
open
the
lid
with
a
dramatic	JJ
gesture
.

Both
of
them
are
involved
in
amateur
dramatics	VBD
.

Georges
dramatics	NNS
were
beginning
to
irritate
me
.

He
knew
all
the
major
English
novelists
,
poets
and
dramatists	NNS
.

The
conflict
has
been
dramatized	VBD|VBN
in
the
newspapers
...

Oh
dear
!
You
do
dramatise
.

He
brought
out
a
shawl
which
he
began
to
drape	VB
carefully
over
Gertrudes
shoulders
...

They
have
draped	VBD|VBN
banners
across
trees
and
bushes
.

...
coffins
draped	VBD|VBN
with
American
flags
...

The
lectern
was
draped	VBD|VBN
in
white
silk
sheets
.

Dust
sheets
draped	VBD|VBN
the
corridors
.

Their
feet
were
draped	VBD|VBN
over
the
empty
seats
in
front
of
them
.

The
drapes	NNS
were
drawn
and
the
lights
turned
off
.

...
the
idealized
drapery	
of
Renaissance
saints
...

A
little
wind
fluttered
her
silk
draperies	NNS
as
she
leant
forward
...

Crimson
draperies	NNS
were
looped
along
the
walls
.

This
may
force
the
Government
to
take
drastic	JJ
measures
...

This
drastic	JJ
step
may
result
in
the
loss
of
everything
.

...
the
recent
drastic	JJ
decline
in
flat-building
...

Everybody
should
be
encouraged
to
make
drastic	JJ
changes
in
their
eating
habits
and
life-style
.

The
draught	VBD
from
the
window
stirred
the
papers
on
her
desk
...

They
used
to
open
the
windows
and
doors
to
create
a
draught	VBD
...

She
found
herself
a

corner
to
sit
in
.

I
made
a
trip
to
the
bathroom
for
a
draught	VBD
of
water
...

He
gulped
the
brandy
down
in
one
draught	
...

He
stood
there
drinking
in
great
draughts	NNS
of
the
scented
air
.

I

On

In

My

His
dream	NN
of

These
problems
can
be
evaded
by
retreat
into
a
dream	
world

This
must
stop
,

When

The

The

about
Bakers

wild
duck

My
own
technique
with
a
cricket

was
to
duck	VB

He
ducked	VBD|VBN
his
head
.

She
ducked	VBD|VBN
under

came
up
with
a
large
shell

When
they
see
you
coming

they
duck	VBD
into

holes

He
managed
to
duck	VB
the
blow
.

They
duck	VB
you
right
under

She
has
a

The

Hed
stepped

discovered

was
a

every

That

Old
people
expect

be
treated

the
respect
due	JJ
to
their
age

experience

His
death
was
due	IN
to
natural
causes

My
desire
to
act
was
due	IN
to
Laurence
Oliviers
performance
in

.

Feelings
were
so
intense
that
they
fought
a
duel	
.

a
duel	
between
central

local
government

I
dont
think
I
know

It
might
look
all
right

Ill
bet
you
its
a
duff	JJ
one

Im
a

She
was
a
good
friend
of
six
British
dukes	NNS
...

...
the
Duke	NN
of
York
.

So
he
became
heir
to
a
dukedom	
.

I
thought
the
book
dull	JJ
and
unoriginal
...

Its
a
terribly
dull	JJ
place
;
nothing
much
goes
on
here
at
all
...

I
found
that
he
was
the
same
dull	JJ
sedate
person
he
had
always
been
.

I
often
feel
dull	JJ
and
awkward
when
I
go
to
parties
...

She
became
dull	JJ
and
silent
during
the
last
part
of
the
long
journey
.

The
sea
had
been
a
dull	JJ
grey
...

The
whole
canyon
is
in
dull	JJ
shadow

...
a
dull	JJ
glow
.

Instead
of
the
dull	JJ
boom
we
expected
there
was
a
terrible
crack
...

There
was
a
dull	JJ
thud
as
his
head
hit
the
floor
.

The
dull	JJ
ache
in
her
belly
began
again
...

Because
he
was
fat
,
he
hated
school
games
with
a
dull	JJ
passion
.

...
the
dullest	JJS
boy
in
the
class

...
these
factors
affect
both
intelligent
and
dull	JJ
children
.

What
use
is
a
knife
with
a
dull	JJ
blade

In

Her

De

The

appeared
in
March
as
had
been
promised

I
was
expecting
the
question
which
he
duly	RB
asked
.

She
was
deaf
and
dumb	JJ
from
birth
.

The
girl
stood
,
dumb	JJ
and
sullen
...

We
were
struck
dumb	JJ
with
horror
and
grief
.

They
used
to
call
you
dumb	VBN
if
you
worked
on
a
farm
.

Silence
can
upset
some
people
who
interpret
it
as
dumb	JJ
insolence
...

He
was
in
a
dumb	JJ
rage
.

All
they
bought
me
was
this
dumb	JJ
T-shirt
...

...
in
order
to
prevent
dumb	JJ
mistakes
later
on
.

They
had
watched
many
a
dumbbell	
turn
into
a
national
hero
on
the
baseball
pitch
.

He
was
watching
,
dumbfounded	JJ
,
when
suddenly
he
heard
a
scream
...

...
a
circle
of
dumbfounded	JJ
police
officers
.

Numb
with
fear
,
the
men
followed
dumbly	RB
the
order
to
sit
down
...

For
a
moment
he
stared
dumbly	RB
at
the
wall
.

I
like
the
dress
thats
on
the

They
came
back

dumped	VBD|VBN

She
dumped	VBD|VBN

They

Twelve
tons

have
been
discovered

The

dun	JJ
stretch

He
was
such
a
dunce	
at
school

The
wind
carves
it
into
gulleys

later
into

They
were
driven

Just
dunk	VB
it
thoroughly
in
white
spirit

five
minutes

When
theyre
together
they
make
a
frightening
duo	VBD

I
was
duped	VBD|VBN

The
people
could
see

duped	VBD|VBN

I
couldnt
decide
whether
he
was
a
dupe	NN
or
a
scoundrel
.

This
stimulates
a
duplex	JJ
transaction
.

The
house
was
an
older
duplex	
encircled
by
nicely
shaped
hedges

The

He
was

If

This
way

can
lead

to
self-destruction

emotional
emptiness

You
are
left
with
this
sort

numb
emptiness

I
felt
very
alone

very
small
suddenly
in
this
great
emptiness	
.

The

was
empty	JJ

We
drove
along
apparently

As

He

laid
it
on

She
put
the

dustbin
.

His
life
was
empty	JJ

meaningless

How
shall
I
exist
during
the
empty	JJ
days

He
felt
empty	JJ

beaten
.

You
ought
to
empty	VB
the
water
out

...

Two
men
carrying
a
wooden
keg
emptied	VBD|VBN

The
average
debate
on

was
still
guaranteed

empty	VB
the
House

The

over

the

at
such

a

I
wondered

You

He

A
just
,
ordered
society
without
a
bureaucracy
has
yet
to
be
established	VBD|VBN
...

There
he
had
set
out
to
establish	VB
his
own
business
...

They
had
already
established	VBD|VBN
a
clear
superiority
.

At
six
oclock
they
managed
to
establish	VB
radio
contact
with
the
survivors
.

The
proposal
to
establish	VB
contact
with
pressure
groups
was
warmly
welcomed
...

A
solid
relationship
and
a
mutual
trust
were
established	VBD|VBN
very
early
between
them
.

I
understand
youve
so
far
been
unable
to
establish	VB
the
cause
of
death
...

A
court
of
enquiry
established	VBD|VBN
that
there
were
faults
on
both
sides
.

The
third
world
has
established	VBD|VBN
itself
as
a
low-cost
manufacturer
...

The
Liberals
established	VBD|VBN
themselves
as
the
major
alternative
.

He
immediately
established	VBD|VBN
his
reputation
as
a
radical
...

...
the
performances
that
established	VBD|VBN
his
international
reputation
.

...
the
establishment	
of
free
trade
unions
...

The
establishment	
of
legal
minimum
pay
is
one
of
the
objectives
.

At

one
establishment	NN
in

The
Government
opened
up
its
research
establishments	NNS

the
financial
establishment

The
university
establishment	
couldnt
tolerate
him
.

Singapores
industrial
estates	NNS
are
comparable
to
those
of
any
Western
city

...
a
housing
estate	
.

He
divided
his
estate	
among
his
four
brothers
.

I
esteem	VBD
him
nothing
but
a
fool
.

It
has
been
estimated	VBD|VBN
that
four-fifths
of
the
children
in

suffer
...

The
hurricane
caused

Annes
attitude
to
Tim
...

How
would
you
estimate	VB
our
chances?
...

He
estimated	VBD|VBN
he
would
do
the
hundred
miles
by
noon
.

According
to
some
estimates	VB
the

Moscow
has
clearly
revised
downward
its
crop
estimate	
from
230
million

.

Thomas
wasnt
living
up
to
anyones
estimate	
of
him
...

Ive
had
to
revise
my
estimate	
somewhat
in
her
favour
.

It
is
a
good
idea
to
get
at
least
two
written
estimates	NNS
to
compare
costs
.

His
comments
were
,
in
my
estimation	
,
correct
and
most
useful
...

Their
childrens
estimation	
of
them
will
gradually
get
lower
.

...
an

I
really

I
read
stories
etched	VBD|VBN

It
will
remain

Some
memories
are
etched	VBD|VBN
with
surprising
clarity
.

His
etchings	NNS

never
went
out

fashion
.

the
promise

For

Bobby

What

I
lay
there

Among

Are
our
British
dramatists
equally
unknown

I
gather
that
you
are
very
much
in
favour
of
Britain
being
in
Europe	NNP

She
was

During

We
crowded

With
great
skill
they
evade	VB
the

altogether
...

He
had
found
a
loophole
which
allowed
him
to
evade	VB
responsibility
...

She
never
ever
lied
to
us
or
evaded	VBD|VBN
any

He
circled
the
table

the
smoke

He
caught

a

evasive	JJ
answer

It
was
a
devastating
attack

I
must
be
even	RB
more

Tomorrow

Barber

seemed
content

happy

It
seemed
that

agitated

Even	IN
if

I
bet

live

could
lead
you
up

alleys

so
,
theres
no
real
cause

Even	IN
as

spoke

he
realized

The

This
has
been

Ralph
surprised
himself
,
not
so
much
by
the
quality

his
voice

was
even	JJ

by

She
would
have
had
only
an
even	JJ
chance

being
saved

I
should
think
the
odds

about

Only
those

I
wouldnt

Though
with

I
think
literature
isnt
so
far	IN
from
the

it

As

as
they
could
see

the

was
empty

I
think
it
is
better
that
we
trust
each
other

so
far	IN
as
we
can
while

She

That

to
be
feared
in
so

as
it
threatens
to
dissipate

The

There
was
the
farcical	VBD
episode

My

The

Even

This

not

it

The

Harris
asked

She
feared	VBD|VBN

They
had

There
is
less

Some

age
of
film	
was
probably
over
by
1950
...

I
enjoyed
working
in
films	NNS
.

They
were
like
letters
seen
through
a
film	
of
tears
.

Water
and
soil
would
have
to
be
filtered	VBD|VBN
many
times
to
remove
any
radioactive
matter
.

Light
filtered	VBD|VBN
into
the
room
...

Sounds
of
cheering
filtered	VBD|VBN
in
through
the
closed
window
.

Disturbing
rumours
filtered	VBD|VBN
back
from
the
East
...

The
word
filtered	VBD|VBN
through
about
the
death
camps
.

...
traffic
waiting
to
filter	VB
to
the
right
.

He
was
chain-smoking
his
habitual
filter	
cigarettes
.

...
a
really
filthy	JJ
oven
...

I
noticed
his
filthy	JJ
and
torn
sweater
.

I
caught
her
reading
a
filthy	JJ
book
...

Thats
a
filthy	VBN
thing
to
say
...

...
the
dishonesty
that
prevails
in
this
filthy	JJ
world
we
have
to
live
in
.

...
on
the
final	JJ
morning
of
the
festival
...

We
made
our
second
and
final	JJ
attempt
to
beat
the
record
...

The
final	JJ
letter
was
very
vague
.
Possibly
an
R
.

The
judges
decision
is
final	JJ
...

Youd
be
insane
to
let
him
have
the
final	JJ
say
.

The
story
appeared
in
the
late
final	
.

The
finale	
was
a
spectacular
dance
involving
all
the
members
of
the
cast
.

Im
now
hoping
to
finalize	VB
things
with
the
builders
early
next
week
...

They
would
like
the
deal
to
be
finalized	VBD|VBN
before
I
release
any
keys
.

Trotsky
lived
in
turn
in
Turkey
,
France
,
Norway
and
finally	VBD
Mexico
.

Finally	RB
,
Carol
,
are
you
encouraged
by
the
direction
education

taking?
...

Lets
come
finally	RB
to
the
question
of
pensions
.

A
private
company
will
finance	VB
and
build
the
pipeline
...

...
a
special
job-creation
programme
to
be
financed	VBD|VBN
by
increased
taxes
.

Whether
it
can
be
done
depends
,
of
course
,
on
your
finances	NNS
.

...
an
American
financier	
and
art
collector
...

America
and
Russia
were
both
possible
financiers	NNS
of
the
Aswan
High
Dam
.

He
cannot
find	VB
work
...

She
said
she
would
find	VB
an
electrician
for
us
.

There
is
a
genuine
effort
to
find	VBN
a
solution
...

We
can
now
find	VB
the
area
of
this
triangle
.

He
found	VB
himself
giggling
quite
uncontrollably
.

Some
families
cannot
even
find	VB
enough
money
for
basic
needs
...

How
do
you
find	VB
time
to
write
these
books
?

Nine

An
active
volcano
on

very
alarming

He
mentioned
the
findings	NNS
of

European
Court

Do

I
probed

The

ran
into
a
storm
over
San
Francisco
.

Why
dont
you
take
up
flying	
?

Exotic
fruits
were
specially
flown	VB
in
for
the
occasion
.

Next
year
hes
hoping
to
fly	VB
the
Atlantic
in
a
hot
air
balloon
.

He
jumped
onto
the
platform
with
his
cloak
flying	VBG
.

All
the
flags
were
flying	VBG
and
the
sun
was
shining
.

Im
sorry
,
I
must
fly	VB
...

By
the
time
they
returned
,
their
prisoner
had
flown	VB
.

Rumours
were
flying	VBG
in
official
circles

She
started
to
button
up
the
flies	NNS
of
her
shorts
...

...
a
man
with
his
fly	NN
open
.

She
looked
at
him
as
though
she
were
about
to
fly	VB
at
his
face
...

One
day
the
man
flew	VB
at
me
in
a
temper
...

He
really
let
fly	VB
on
the
subject
of
racism
.

She
took
two
cakes
out
of
the
flyblown	JJ
display
case
.

She
was
taking
tea
with
some
dashing
young
flyers	NNS
.

Hawkmoths
are
among
the
swiftest
insect
flyers	VBD
.

She
rushed
forward
and
took
a
flying	JJ
leap
at
the
fence
.

...
flies
and
other
flying	JJ
insects
.

To
Aunt
Agnes
was
written
in
a
bold
hand
on
the
flyleaf	
.

He
poured
foaming	VBG
champagne
into
her
glass
...

The
icy
cold
water
foamed	VBD|VBN
over
the
side
of
the
boat
.

The
sea
was
all
glossy
and
pale
and
foamy	JJ
like
ginger
beer
.

...
foamy	JJ
clusters
of
cream-coloured

His
eyes
,
bandaged
for
twenty-four
hours

would
not
focus	VB

He
tried
to
focus	VBP
his
eyes
on
a
painting
above
Ellens
head
...

Each
man
was
focusing	VBG
a
large
telescope
.

The
only
part
of
the
picture
which
was
in
clear
focus	NN
was
a
small
child
...

The
camera
was
a
bit
out
of
focus	
when
I
took
that
one
...

Im
just
trying
to
get
the
focus	
right
.

He
took
the
glass
and
focused	VBD
the
sun
on
some
dried
wood
.

As
we
cannot
study
all
resources
,
I
propose
to
focus	VB
attention
on
one
...

Attention
focussed
on
Jack
.

Changes
in
the
urban
environment
are

the
focus	NN

public
interest

This
story
is
used
as
a
focus	NN
for
discussion
...

He
expected
to
be
the
evenings
chief
focus	NN
of
attention
.

The
focus	
on
money
and
position
tends
to
foster
rivalry
...

A
shift
in
focus	
had
occurred
away
from
issues
of
civil
liberty
.

Its
people
are
cannon
fodder	NN
in
wars
with
bordering
states

The

were
uselesswaste-basket

.

He
was
succeeded
by
his
political
foe

Taylor

The

challenged
him

Who
goes
there

Friend

surrounds
the

foetus

I
hate
driving

Then
the
fog	
came
down

Winter
brought
the

They
all
smoked
cigarettes

there
was
a
constant

Through

he

My

Gradually
the

Their

Their

She
had
bronzed

her
yellow

a

Cranberries

Fold	VB

There
was
a
piece

You

in

The

The

Renounce

By

Walker

to
open
an

in
London

follow	VB
it

a
bottling
hall

He
followed	VBD|VBN
up
this
criticism
of
the
Governments
record
with
a
personal
attack
on
the
Prime
Minister

He
murmured
the
word
quietly

with
great
venom

following	VBG
up
with
a
string
of
oaths

The
main

Many
advantages

Hunger

Just
because

doesnt
follow	VB
that
they
have
to
be
patronized

...
it
doesnt
necessarily
follow	VB
...

A
disturbing
conclusion
followed	VBD|VBN
from
that
.

I
learned
most
of
what
follows	VBZ
from
a
parlourmaid
called
Louise
...

Several
paragraphs
followed	VBD|VBN
to
the
effect
that
things
were
getting
worse
.

The
boundary

the
Rio

river

The

Its

Eric

the

Ralph
shaded
his
eyes
and
followed	VBD|VBN

Frogs
have
followed	VBP
a
very
different

Their

Other

the
trend

the
major
ones

Where
America
leads

the

Is
it

Edith

Michael
Manley
followed	VBD|VBN
his
father
into
politics
.

I
could
see
he
was
following	VBG
the
play
attentively
.

One
man
who
follows	VBZ
its
fortunes
closely
is
Christopher
Poll
...

...
the
thousands
of
American
couples
who
followed	VBD|VBN
the

we
can
follow	VB
the

Her
story

English
family

The

He
liked
to
follow	VB
the
score

music
.

They
followed	VBD|VBN
Cromwell
during
the
fighting
...

Most
of
them
follow	VB
the
Buddhist
faith
.

He
was
asked
to
follow	VB
a
particular
line
of
research
...

Tempting
though
it
may
be
to
follow	VB
this
point
through
,
it
is
not
really
relevant
.

She
has
a
keen
following	
among
rock
fans
...

This
religion
is
too
stark
to
attract
a
large
following	NN
.

Fortunately
we
had
a
following	JJ
wind
that
day
.

He
proposed
an
early
start
for
the
first
group
with
a
follow-on	
of
two
more
groups
the
next
day
.

This
wouldnt
halt
the
attack
but
it
would
at
least
blunt
the
follow-through	
.

He
held
his
follow-through	
pose
for
10
seconds
.

There
will
be
a
follow-up	JJ
programme
next
month
to
report
on
the
progress
made
...

He
needed
follow-up	JJ
treatment
from
a
specialist
doctor
.

This
conference
is
a
follow-up	
to
an
earlier
one
in
Gabon
.

It
would
be
folly	
to
continue
...

There
is
no
limit
to
the
folly	
of
mankind

The
government
persisted
in
its
folly

...
the
art

fomenting	VBG
distrust

he
was

fond	JJ

Im
not

fond	JJ

He
was
fond	JJ
of
pointing
out
that
children
in
the
past
were
to
be
seen

not

Mothers

such
as
cookies

It
would
be
foolish	JJ
to
suppose

it
is
an
easy
thing

change

They
looked
foolish	JJ

It

romantic

book

The
machine
was
foolproof	VBD

He
sat
at

his
sons

at
the
foot

the
grave

Suddenly
he
heard
heavy
footfalls	NNS
behind
him

the
Himalayas

It
was
necessary
to
find
a
way
to
gain
a
foothold	
in
the
organization
...

The
guerillas
established
a
firm
foothold	NN
by
offering
protection
against
the
government
.

He
lost
his
footing	
,
and
stumbled
to
the
floor

When
you
reach
the
rocks

be
sure
of
your
footing	
before
you
let

She
could
not
gain
her
footing

the
water
was
too
deep
and
too
fast
.

Weve
had
to
get
this
on
a
more
official
footing

The
transition
to
a
war
footing	
had
really
gone
very
smoothly

The

be
made

The

Forecasts	NNS

The

Much

freighted	VBD|VBN
overland

It
generated
much
excitement

frenetic	JJ
activity
.

They
were
whipping
up
nationalist
frenzy	
among
the
excitable
crowds
...

There
was
a
a
squeal
of
pain
,
and
the

hopped
round

.

They
were
singing
in
a
frenzy	
of
joy

...
a
frenzy	
of
kissing

champagne
cork
popping

Most
of
the

hear
have
frequencies	NNS

around
several
hundred
vibrations
a

The

itself
was
of
very

Jo

She
had
a

We

You

The
brief

It

You

The

Malawians
seemed

You

We

quite
a

friendly	JJ
arguments
.

They
were
called
friendlies	NNS
but
they
were
really
tough
matches
.

I
didnt
want
to
spoil
a
promising
relationship
by
getting
too
friendly	JJ
too
soon
.

Their
friendship	
was
as
close
as
ever
it
had
been
...

...
the
ability

My

He

promote
Anglo-German
friendship	
.

She
had
given
him
a
fright	
too
,
to
judge
from
the
way
his
mouth
hung
open
...

Because
she
had
got
a
fright	
she
sounded
angry
at
first
.

I
want

be

They

We

There

About
100,000

You

They
used
to
deliver

We

The

When

She
begins
to
harbour	VB
resentments

turn

You
must
remember
that
she
has
broken

get
into

She
slammed

Give

We
laughed

cries

It

I
think
we
still
managed
to
impress
them

There
was
really
no

for
such
high-handed	JJ

obviously
thought
very
highly	RB

This

I
launched

Kangaroos

Her
career
was
not
noticeably
hindered	VBD|VBN
by
the
fact
that
she
had
three
children
...

More
people
have
been
hindered	VBD|VBN

I
wrenched
at
the
clothes
that
hindered	VBD|VBN
me
.

Here
new
ideas
may
be
more
of
a
hindrance	
than
an
asset
.

The
front
door
gaped
open
,
hanging
away
by
its
lower
hinge	VBN
.

She
lifted
the
hinged	JJ
flap

gestured
that

come
through

As

appeared
as

The

They
gave
me
a

with
useful

for

Her
smile
held
a
tiny
hint	
of
a
challenge
...

The
struggle
would
be
difficult
,

there
was
already
a
hint	VBD

saw
Martin
driving
by

They
pointed
and
hooted	VBD|VBN
with
enjoyment
...

I
fled
,
pursued
by
the
hooting	VBG
mob
.

At
this
Etta
gave
a
hoot	
of
laughter
...

...
booing
and
hoots	NNS
of
scorn
.

Outside
,
an
owl
hooted	VBD|VBN
among
the
pines
.

He
heard
the
hoot	
of
an
owl
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
wood
.

The
hooter	NN
sounded
out
like
a
foghorn
.

Hes
got
a
hooter	NN
the
size
of
an
elephants
.

She
began
the
daily
round
of
washing
and
hoovering	VBG
.

...
hopping	VBG
clumsily
up
and
down
in
their
chains
.

They
began
jumping
up
and
down
together
in
short
hops	NNS
.

All
the
birds
were
hopping	VBG
about
on
their
perches
...

A
hare
hopped	VBD|VBN
straight
into
the
doorway
.

a
bird
so
heavy
that
it
could
make
only
short
,
low
hops	NNS
through
the
brush
.

...
a
fifty-five
minute
Paris
hop	VBD

They
always
run
a
dance

sort
of
hop	
,
on
Sunday
night
.

...
the

gardens
of
Sussex
.

She
hoped	VBD|VBN
to
leave
that
evening
for
her
sisters
in
Scotland
...

Youll
be
home
at
six?I
hope	VB
so
.

The
only
benefits
they
can
hope	VB
to
gain
are
through
the
additional
employment
...

None
of
them
could
hope	VB
to
get
rich
...

That
would
be
too
much
to
hope	VB
for
.

Technical
co-operation
is
the
only
hope	
for
progress
...

There
was
not
a
hope	
for
them
.

All
their
hopes	NNS
were
dashed
...

...
the
hopes	NNS
and
dreams
of
reformers
...

But
it
was
a
forlorn
hope	
.

Youre
our
only
hope	
now
...

Rudolph
was
the
hope	
of
the
family
.

He
sounded
hopeful	JJ
that
she
would
come
...

Ever
hopeful	JJ
,
McKellen
never
abandoned
the
cinema
...

There
was
a
queue
of
people
hopeful	JJ
of
obtaining
the
few
seats
available
.

The
use
of
volunteers
has
resulted
in
the
most
astonishing
and
hopeful	JJ
results
...

This
seems
to
me
to
be
a
hopeful	JJ
way
of
tackling
the
problem
.

Little
groups
of
beggars
made
hopeful	JJ
sorties
towards
the
tourists
.

This
news
was
very
hard
indeed
for
presidential
hopefuls	VB
in
an
election
year
...

Almost
a
hundred
hopefuls	NNS
stood
in
a
queue
outside
the
theatre
.

He
smiled
hopefully	RB
in
their
direction
...

We
must
proceed
hopefully	RB
on
the
basis
of
what
we
know
...

Can
we
come
in
?
she
asked
hopefully	RB
.

I
walked
away
in
an
agony
of
hopeless	JJ
grief
and
pity

She
was

With

I
knew
my

The

was

His

the
beginning

He
was

I
proved
to

She
described

They
will
never

the
blood

horror

Sometimes
his

would
dwell
on
the
horrors	NNS
he
had
been
through

Come

Did
you

Roland
was
horror-stricken	JJ
at
what
hed
done
.

He
was
seen
riding
a
horse	
through
the
streets
of
London
...

In
the
early
twentieth
century
the
internal
combustion
engine
replaced
the
horse	
.

She
saw
a
picture
of
Piccadilly
almost
jammed
with
horse-drawn	VBD
traffic
in
about
1875
.

Horsemen	
would
arrive
and
tether
their
horses
to
the
rail
...

He
was
sent
to
Curragh
Camp
in
Ireland
because
he
was
such
a
fine
horseman	
.

climate

It
seems
to
make
the
soil
more
alkaline
and
more
hospitable	JJ
to
plants
.

I
was
working
at
the
hospital

I
used
to
visit
him
in
hospital

...
a
psychiatric
hospital	
.

I
said
that
her
mother
was
hospitalized	VBD|VBN
and
that
the
situation
was
grave
...

The
most
effective
way
of
stopping
this
is
to
hospitalize	VB
him
for
a
brief
period
.

There
were
only

was

Within
a

his

had
supplied
him

He
has

Im
sure
the
audience
has
a
host	
of
fascinating
questions
for
our
team

We
visited
a
whole

suggested

The

Even
the

The

He
eventually
insinuated	VBD|VBN
himself

The

invariably
insinuates	VBZ

I

.

Uncle
Duff
was
quite
jovial	JJ
at
tea
that
evening
...

He
was
a
big
,
heavy
,
jovial	JJ
man
.

...
an
old
woman
with
heavy
jowls	NNS
and
a
double
chin
.

She
discovered
the
joy	
of
writing
...

His
one
joy	
is
playing
squash
...

Her
sheer
professionalism
made
her
a
joy	
to
watch
.

The
total
effect
is
so
intensely
joyful	JJ
that
it
comes
across
like
dance
therapy
...

I
still
felt
sad
even
after
youd
announced
the
joyful	JJ
tidings
...

I
think
she
has
got
something
serious
as
well
as
joyful	JJ
to
offer
young
people
.

The
joyful	JJ
parents
named
him
Lexington

A
deliriously
joyful	JJ
boy
came
running
into
the
village
.

...
years
and
years
of
joyless	JJ
married
life
...

I
hope
I
never
become
as
joyless	JJ
as
they
have
become
.

That
joyride	
,
I
grant
you
,
was
a
silly
stunt
...

...
a
bunch
of
kids
out
for
a
joyride	
.

Easing

joystick

Last

she
appeared
before
a
judge	
...

Judge	
Arnason
set
Miss
Davis
free
on
bail
...

The
judge	
ruled
that
those
statements
could
not
be
allowed
as
evidence
.

The
panel
of
judges	NNS
consisted
of
a
variety
of
famous
people
...

The
judges	NNS
decision
is
final
and
no
correspondence
will
be
entered
into
.

He
knew
Muller
would
be
a
good
judge	NN
of
character
...

Nick
,
a
perfect
judge	
of
such
matters
,
had
ordered
a
light
French
wine
.

I
have
been
judging	VBG
village
flower
shows
and
gardens
for
nearly
thirty
years
...

The
competition
was
judged	VBD|VBN
by
the
local
mayor
.

She
seemed
to
be
watching
him
,
judging	VB
him
...

Social
workers
declare
that
they
are
not
out
to
judge	VBD
people

but
simply
want
to
help
.

There
was
some
great
national
celebration
in
town
,
judging
by
the
firework
displays
everywhere
...

The
new
king
was
attractive
,
to
judge	IN
from
the
newspaper

The
final
judgment
will
probably
be
made
in

Mr

They

Both

He
was

with
figures

possibilities
.

He
juggled	VBD|VBN
with
the
controls
.

I
had
watched
a
juggler	NN
practising
his
act
.

I
felt
like
sliding
my
pointed
nail
file
into
her
jugular	
vein
.

spooning
the
juices	NNS

If

Just
turn
on
the
juice	
,
and
well
see
if
it
works
.

He
had
a
longing
for
some
juicy	JJ
,
red-ripe
tomatoes
.

The
title
part
of
the

a
kaleidoscopic
jumble	
of
colours

noises

.

The
bits
and
pieces
were
jumbled	VBD|VBN
up
with
a
lot
of
stuff
that
would
never
be
needed
again
...

If
a
sentence
is
jumbled	VBD|VBN
,
a
child
can
be
asked
to
arrange
it
correctly

He
jumped	VBD|VBN
down

The

Crowds
of
photographers
jumped	VBD|VBN
out

the
shadows
.

A
sudden
noise
made
Brody
jump	VB
.

What
annoys
me
is
the
way
you
jumped	VBD|VBN
from
one
thing
to
another
.

...
sudden
conversational
jumps	NNS
in
either
direction
.

The
horses
are
on
the
race
course
and
the
fence
is
there
so
theyve
got
to
jump	VB
it
.

They
hold
a
pencil
as
if
it
might
jump	VB
out
of
their
hand
...

His
body
jumped	VBD
and
twitched
.

The
population
jumped	VBD|VBN
to
nearly
10,000
...

The
rate
of
price
increase
throughout
the
western
world
jumped	VBD|VBN
dramatically
.

...
a
massive
jump	
in
expenditure
.

Oh
sorry
,
have
I
jumped	VBD|VBN
some
questions
?

I
thought
you
were
good
at
jumping	VBG
queues

street

The
Crime
Squad
says
four
guys
jumped	VBD|VBN
you
.

...
what
a
mighty
jump	
forward
...

Eventually
however
,
a
further
huge
jump	
was
made
.

You
are
only
one
jump	
away
from
your
goal
...

Her
need
was
to
keep
one
jump	
ahead
of
her
opponents
moves
.

This
particular
monkey
is
the
most
magnificent
jumper	
of
all

She
turned
and
made
her
way
through
the
jungle	
of
tables
towards
the
back
of
the
room
.

Here
,
for
instance
,
its
a
jungle	
in
which
the
weakest
go
to
the
wall
...

Hed
never
have
got
anywhere
in
the
jungle	VBD
of
real
politics
.

Police
officers
later
chided
their
juniors	NNS
for
not
spotting
these
clues
.

The
juniors	NNS
have
a
different
uniform

She
was

the
age

seventy-seven

years

junior	
.

Its
over
500

lodging
,
but
a
comparable
junket	
to
Hawaii
costs
only
389
.

Of
course
Im
worried
.
Youre
turning
into
a
junkie	NN
!

Their
decision
was
based
on
the
authority
of
leading
jurists	NNS
.

She
was
sworn
in
,
along
with
eleven
other
jurors	NNS

Wed

to

the
opinion

our
jury

Im
just	RB
coming...
Im
just	RB

Chris

They
were
just	RB
about
to
leave
when
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
.

I
dont
want
you
to
ask
any
questions
just	RB
at
the
moment
.

The
expression
just	IN
as
is
used
to
say
that
one
thing
happened
at
exactly
the
same
time
as
something
else
.

These
are
just	RB
a
few
of
the
enquiries
which
may
come
in
...

Thats
just	RB
one
aspect
of
my
work
.

They
were
just	RB
thirty
yards
away

Brandt
was
just	RB
eighteen
when
Hitler
came
to
power

If
only
I
could
see
it
oncejust
once
.

Just	RB
listen
to
that
noise

Albert

Just	RB
look
at

Judy
,
just	RB

an
opportunity

I
think
we
all
look
very
smart.Dont
we
just!
...

Hes
a
good
talker
,
isnt
he?Isnt
he
just	RB
.

We
were
prepared
for
just	VBD
this
eventuality
...

Ive
been
waiting
for
just	RB
such
an
occasion
...

Thats
just	RB
what
I
wanted
to
hear
.

Ah
yes
,
I
can
just	RB
see
him
as
a
dentist
...

What
a
wonderful
description
.
I
can
just	RB
smell
the
sea
air
...

Oh
,
I
can
just	RB
taste
that
gorgeous
cheese
.

I
wonder
if
we
can
just	RB
turn
our
attention
to
something
you
mentioned
earlier
...

Can
I
just	RB
use
your
lighter
,
Ive
run
out
of
matches
...

If
you
can
just	RB
sign
there
please
.

I
believe
my
Sam
here
would
be
just	RB
the
person!
...

He
knew
just	RB
the
place
.

That
will
be
just	RB
forty
pounds
.

He
stuck
the
knife
right
in
,
just	RB
here
...

...
just	VB
opposite
St
Georges
Square
.

Rattlesnake
is
just	RB
like
chicken
,
only
tougher
...

Ive
received
just	RB
the
same
orders
as
you
have
...

She
was
just	RB
as
fat
as
he
was
and
just	RB
as
unattractive
.

Let
us
be
cautious
in
our
actions
,
cautious
but
just	JJ
...

...
an
orderly
,
just	JJ
,
and
civilised
society
.

...
the
difference
between
a
just	JJ
and
an
unjust
cause
...

...
a
just	JJ
war
.

It
would
be
much
more
satisfactory
if
new
ideas
were
the
just	JJ
reward
for
hard
work
and
persistent
effort
...

Do
you
think
that
imprisonment
represents
a
just	JJ
or
an
unjust
punishment
?

I
hope
this
is
a
justifiable	JJ
interpretation
...

I
couldnt
even
call
it
a
justifiable	JJ
Womens
Lib
attitude
.

I
think
he
was
quite
justified	JJ
in
refusing
to
help
her
.

In
these
circumstances
,
massive
industrial
action
is
justified	JJ
and
necessary
.

Our
latest
model
offers
a
facility
for
justified	JJ
margins
.

The
decision
has
therefore
been
fully
justified	VBD|VBN
...

Research
programmes
almost
always
justify	VB
themselves
by
producing
some
pattern
or
other
...

Such
measures
are
easily
justified	VBD
and
meet
with
approval
.

So
how
did
they
justify	VB
putting
the
thing
on
a
gallery
wall?
...

Im
not
going
to
try
and
justify	VB
or
excuse
myself
...

She
had
no
need
to
justify	VB
herself
.

the
bit
where
the
living
room
window
juts	VBZ
out

There
,

a
kaleidoscope	
of
colours

patiently
.

It
was
a
kamikaze	JJ
mission
.

The
record

seems
to
be
kaput	JJ
.

Her
solicitor
was
much
keener	JJR
to
talk
to
her
than
she
was
to
talk
to
him

Hes
not
at
all
keen	JJ

anybody
else

know
that

Im
never
very
keen	JJ

He
was
not

keen	JJ

Boys
are

keen	JJ
on
cooking
as
girls
are

a
keen	JJ

We
should
be

an
abler

keener	JJR

more
resourceful
President

He
took
a
keen	JJ

keen	JJ
desire

see
the

Molly
was
very
keen	JJ
on

His
face
was
,
like
a
soldiers

an
explorers

stern

keen	JJ
in
its
expression

Nobody

A

ribs
left
him
gasping
for
breath

He
gave
him
a
good
kick

One
of
those

He
was
kicked
so
severely
in

he
never
fully
regained

health

He

If

It

Ill

you

pain
...

They

He
spent
long
hours

Could
I

The

hated

believe

yet
the
logic

Their

newspaper

show
that
this
idea

absurd

Could
you
take
a
look	
at
this
please
,
John
?

Dont
give
me
such
severe
looks	NNS
.
What
have
I
done?
...

She
gave
me
a
look	
and
said
,
I
dont
suppose
you
like
me
much
.

Since
youre
so
close
,
you
really
ought
to
take
a
look	
at
the
canals
of
Venice
...

The
interior
of
the
building
is
well
worth
a
look	
.

Have
another
look	
.
It
must
be
there
.

Britain
is
looking	VBG
for
a
peaceful
,
diplomatic
solution
...

What
we
are
looking	VBG
for
is
a
firm
commitment
on
the
part
of
the
government
.

The
figures
indicate
we
have
to
take
a
hard
look	
at
the
whole
situation
...

Tonight
were
going
to
have
a
look	
at
some
aspects
of
the
social
services
.

If
youre
a
Democrat
,
you
look	VB
at
things
one
way
,
and
if
youre
a
Republican
you
look	VB
at
them
in
a
very
different
way
...

Look	VB
at
it
my
way
.

The
kitchen
window
looks	VBZ
out
onto
a
yard
...

Our
house
looks	VBZ
out
over
the
reservoir
.

This
years
look	NN
is
short
skirts
and
T-shirts
...

...
the
punk
look	NN
.

It
was
only
the
Ministers
look-alike	VBZ
.

James
talks
so
much
that
all
the
others
barely
get
a
look-in	NN
.

Two
of
the
burglars
were
tipped
off
by
a
lookout	NN
and
escaped
...

...
a
nights
lookout	
duty
.

As
you
get
closer
they
loom	VBG
above
you
like
icebergs
.

The
shadow
of
euthanasia
will
loom	VB
ever
closer
...

Strictness
or
permissiveness?This
looms	VBZ
as
a
big
question
for
many
new
parents
.

...
industrial
problems
ranging
from
technology
gaps
to
looming	VBG
trade
wars
.

A
series
of
rods
carry
the
threads
into
the
loom	
.

...
some
poor
old
loony	
repeating
the
same
bit
of
nonsense
.

With
any
luck
the
ring
will
have
fallen
in
the
loop	
of
pipe
under
the
sink
...

Her
wavy
hair
fell
in
loose
wisps
and
loops	VB
upon
her
shoulders
.

Ropes
were
being
looped	VBD|VBN
around
him
and
he
was
helpless
to
resist
.

Trails
loop	VB
and
weave
through
the
tall
trees
.

I
would
need
to
add
an
extra
loop	
involving
fifty
or
so
steps
.

The
next
Labour
government
intends
to
tighten
the
loopholes	NNS
in
those
acts
.

The
doorknob
is
loose	JJ
and
rattles
...

Make
sure
that
there
are
no
loose	JJ
strands
of
wire
...

One
tooth
was
missing
and
another
so
loose	JJ
that
it
was
going
to
be
missing
very
soon
.

...
a
few
loose	JJ
sheets
of
paper
...

They
had
time
to
rake
up
all
the
loose	JJ
corn
before
the
farmer
came
back
...

Green
leaves
had
been
beaten
loose	JJ
by
the
rain
of
the
night
before
.

Mary
wore
loose	JJ
clothes
that
did
not
show
off
her
figure
...

He
was
hot
beneath
the
loose	JJ
cotton
shirt
.

His
mouth
was
slack
,
his
cheeks
loose	JJ
and
flabby
...

Her
skin
hung
loose	JJ
and
grey
.

Her
long
brown
hair
was
loose	JJ
about
her
shoulders
...

...
her
brittle
blonde
hair
hung
loose	JJ
.

Avoid
loose	JJ
weaves
which
will
develop
holes
quickly
.

He
had
taken
a
pair
of
white
rats
into
the
church
and
had
let
them
loose	VB
on
the
floor
...

Johns
answer
to
this
was
to
tear
himself
loose	JJ
,
and
go
down
on
his
knees
.

The
younger
generation
in
particular
have
tended
to
cut
loose	JJ
from
the
tentacles
of
class
background
...

It
might
be
better
if
the
children
were
let
loose	JJ
a
bit
earlier
.

There
were
men
sitting
in
loose	JJ
groups
all
around
the
square
.

They
thought
that
loose	JJ
organization
was
more
democratic
...

A
loose	JJ
grouping
of
radicals
was
formed
which
met
once
a
week
.

Im
sorry
that
I
have
to
use
this
rather
loose	JJ
terminology
but
I
hope
youll
know
what
I
mean
.

He
tried
to
keep
away
from
loose	JJ
women
.

It
remained
to
be
seen
whether
the
gambling-fever
loosed	VBD|VBN
by
the
earlier
Act
would
be
ended
by
the
new
law
.

With
the
aid
of
a
screwdriver
,
loosen	VB
the
two
screws
at
each
end
...

The
tyre
on
one
of
his
wheels
had
loosened	VBD|VBN
...

The
wind
had
loosened	VBD|VBN
some
leaves
.

He
loosened	VBD|VBN
his
seat-belt
...

He
took
off
his
jacket
and
loosened	VBD|VBN
his
tie
...

She
loosened	VBD|VBN
her
hair
and
began
to
unbutton
her
dress
.

The
effect
of
boarding
school
is
often
to
loosen	VB
ties
between
children
and
their
parents
...

The
organization
has
been
able
to
loosen	VB
its
dependence
on
existing
political
institutions
.

They
eventually
loosened	VBD|VBN
the
strait-jacket
policy
of
Republicanism
.

There
was
widespread
looting	
of
stores
and
shops
.

It
was
Napoleons
greatest
boast
to
have
looted	VB
it
from
the
Vatican
.

He
borrowed
it
a
fortnight
ago
to
lop	VB
his
plum
tree
.

The
keeper
came
loping	VBG
softly
up
the
lane
...

The
dog
started
to
lope	VB
alongside
my
car
.

She
settled
into
the
easy
deceptive
lope	
of
the
experienced
athlete
.

Gradually
a
lopsided	JJ
smile
settled
on
her
face
.

He
is
an
easy
,
loquacious	JJ
man
...

They
soon
formed
a
loquacious	JJ
group
around
the
car
.

Serfs
would
provide
their
lord	
with
labour
and
produce
,
and
in
exchange
he
would
protect
them
.

If
your
Lordship	
will
give
me
time
I
will
produce
the
evidence.

Im
sorry
,
sir
,
his
Lordship	
is
in

Their

I

If

did

we
would
lose	VB

thick
you
could

He
had
lost	VB
a
finger

part

I
lost	VB

I
was

He

He

...
you
lose	VB
some
of

major
advantage

Bill
lost	VB
no
time
in
telling
everyone
about
his
idea
.

At
one
time
the
company
was
losing	VBG
a
million
pounds
a
week
...

State-owned
industries
are
losing	VBG
millions
of
dollars
.

My
watch
loses	VBZ
about
five
minutes
a
day
.

They
expected
to
lose	VB
the
election
...

They
have
lost	VBP
six
games
and
won
ten
...

Nobody
expected
her
to
lose	VB
.

That
mistake
lost	VB
us
the
game
.

I
couldnt
help
losing	VBG
my
way
in
the
maze
of
their
well-meaning
instructions
.

Both
men
were
again
lost	VBN

He
lost	VB
himself

She
sat
with
her
camera

lost	VB
in
concentration
.

Im
afraid
his
humour
is
just
lost	VB
on
me
.

I
am
lost	VB
without

After
one
match

the
loser	VBD
actually
sent
him
a
present

the
winners

losers	NNS
in

Youre

You
told
me
about

magazine
you
were
going
to
publisha
real
loser	
,
it
sounded
like
.

She
will
probably
conclude
that
she
will
be
the
loser	
if
she
fails

respond

friendly
overtures

Some

Death

The

The

Allied
artillery
fire

heavy

In
the
past
the
loss	
of
a
baby
was
almost
commonplace
...

That
does
not
make
up
for
the
loss	
of
my
daughter
and
husband
.

Hell
be
no
great
loss	
when
he
goes
...

You
must
consider
it
rather
a
gain
than
a
loss	
.

There
was
that
time
when
we
got
lost	JJ
out

I

I

Dietary

They

By

Time

now
been

The

I

He
went

Tewkesbury

I
admitted

She
saw

He
pushed
his
glasses
lower	JJR
on
his
nose

looked
at
the
men
over
them

The
low	JJ
sun
cast
long
shadows

The
afternoon
sun
was
low	JJ
above

When
their

a

Smithy
spoke

There
was
a

murmur

He
turned
the

The

The

We

The

This
whole

to
rest

grunted

them
in
monosyllables	NNS

which
was
all
that
was
necessary

The

My

Education

The

was
then

it
is

The

convey
much	RB

We
were
walking
through

mucky	JJ
wet

With

wouldnt
muddle	VB

Dont
muddle	VBD
her

I
have
got

Her

betrayed
nothing

muddle

inattention

He
was
dismissed
as
a
muddle-headed	VB
mischief-maker

The
brook
was
a

The

real

The

A

muffled	VBD|VBN
up

A
long

twined

I
was
given

He
drank

.

They
would
lurk
in

dark
side

mug	VB

Mugging	
in
the
streets

was
not
uncommon

There
has
been
a
great
increase
in
football

It
was
fixed
to
the
wall
between
a
crooners
mug

the
lashes

a

Keep
your
ugly
mug	
out

He
was
no

took
the
proffered
couple

I
was
stepping
out

set
his

down

After
changing

We
wanted
Richard
Burton
to
narrate	VB
it

he
was
too
busy
in
Switzerland

The
narrative	
of
her
battle
against
suicidal
depression
makes
fascinating
reading
...

Maybe
all
of
that
is
true
,
but
thats
not
what
the
narrative	VBD
is
about

He
was
netting	VBG
his
third

largest
fortune
.

The
plastics
began
netting	VBG
1
billion
a
year
for
the

.

That
gave
him
a
net	JJ

just

23%

Last

made

It

Because
I
was
neutral	JJ
in

I
was
a

It
is
essential
that
we
transform
them
from
active
enemies

passive
neutrals	NNS
.

I
undertake
to
preserve
a
strictly
neutral	JJ
position
during
this
debate
...

Youre
not
getting
a
neutral	JJ
,
unbiased
view

.

Their
decision
was
neutral	JJ

I
waited

she
said
in

Hence

Pollocks

With
a

notable	JJ

this

Divide-and-rule

been

Some

The

Thus

It

His

noted	VBD|VBN
with
regret

were
beginning
to
look
bored

It
is
important
for
us
to
note	VB
three
basic
facts
.

The
sale
is
noted	VBD|VBN
in
the
gunsmiths

Often
,
he
noted	VBD|VBN
the
exact
time

place

.

Wages
have
,
as
already
noted	VBD|VBN
,
a
dual
function
in
the
economy
...

A
government
report
released
last
week
noted	VBD|VBN
an
alarming
rise
in
racial
harassment
.

The
slow
music
rang
out
,
note	
by
solemn
note	
.

Not
one
of
them
could
read
a
note	
of
music

...
the
variation
in
the
depth

The
boars
note	
changed
to
a
squeal
.

There
was
a
note	
of
triumph
in
her
voice
...

His
voice
took
on
a
new
note	
of
uncertainty
.

I
would
,
on
a
slightly
more
serious
note	
,
caution
the
Party
against
over-confidence
...

Sensing
this
would
be
a
good
note	
on
which
to
end
the
interview
,
I
got
up..
This
will
strike
the
correct
note

a

its
picturesque

It
was
noteworthy	JJ
that
the
Count
was
the
only
person
who
did
not
seem
to
care.
...

One
noteworthy	JJ
fact
is
that
members
of
the
staff
seldom
complain
.

All
that
was
nothing	JJ
,
absolutely
nothing	VBD
,
to
the
joy
that
I
felt
when
I
saw
her

I
hate
you

Youre
disgusting

Youre
nothing	JJ

This

He
achieved
some
public
notice	
in
later
life

Nevertheless
,
they
deserve
notice

respect
.

At
the
main
entrance
gates

there
was
a
large
notice	NN
which
said

Someone
put
up
a

Shortly
after

they
ceased

One
can
still
see

Deaths

The
computer
can
issue
invoices

It
did
not
have
any
noticeable	JJ
effect
upon
the
rate

It
was
noticeable	VBP

the
knuckles

were
bruised

The
corridor
seemed
to
be
decorated
entirely

You
will
normally
be
sent
an
official

The

The

notify	VB

The
notion	
that
the
earth

rejected
long

...
the
notion

He
had
only
the

notion

it

all
about

Ive
a
notion	
to
go

find
him

A
notional	JJ
rent
element

included

I
first
arrived
in

of
the
novelties	NNS

most
noxious	JJ
smell

She
would
never
harm
an

noxious	JJ

She
turned
the

spray
concentrated
down

stream

She
had
to
repeat

the
details

her
conversation

the
range

We
ought
to
get
down

the
nub

the
matter

It
reduces
her
case

its
legal
nub

I
should
like
to
see
Europe
as
a
nuclear-free	JJ
zone

The
fundamental
particles
make
nuclei

the
nuclei	VBD
join
in
atoms

It
is
possible
to
transplant
chromosomes

These

would
form

nucleus

a
future
regime

the
tradition
of
the
male
nude	
in

He
was
tone

had
to
be
nudged	VBD|VBN

The

His

His
father
occasionally
sent
him
solid
gold
nuggets	NNS

...
curious

enlightening
nuggets	VBG

They
came
up
with
the
nugget	
that
in
1918
he
had
been
involved
in
dubious
business
speculations

This
had
the
effect

nullifying	VBG
our
original
advantage

The
whole

be
nullified	VBD|VBN

Each

right

The

was
issued

it

stopped

took
her
off
up

it
directly
overhead

taking

the

path

He
saw
public
ownership
as
only
one
of
many
paths	NNS
to
achieving
a
socialist
society

It
was
pathetic	VBD

much
become
almost
totally
blind

The

Why
should
I
be
penalized	VBD|VBN

It
would
be
unfair

an
amateur
performance

How
is

Great
Britains
poor

performance

a
disappointing
performance	
in
the
220-yards

It
was
not

I
wonder
what
brought
on
that
little
performance	NN
!

Its
a
bit
of
a
performance	
,
I
know
,
but
its
worth
it
in
the
end
.

...
the
performance	
of
his
Presidential
duties
...

...
as
if
it
were
the
performance

some
elaborate
court
ritual
.

...
a
gifted
performer

He
earned
a
useful
living
as
a
night
club
performer	
.

His
supporters
are
all
wondering
why
he
is
such
a
rotten
performer	
on
television
when
he
is
such
a
brilliant
speaker
in
Parliament
.

...
a
faint
smell

perfume

small
bottle

The
familiar
perfumes	NNS

nostrils

air
was
cool

sweet

perfumed	JJ

the
scent

He
handed
her
a
perfumed	JJ
towel

There
was

perfunctory	JJ
search

his
bags

London

Max
gave

wife

Not
many

used
to
go

edge

said
nothing

had
forgotten

it

There
are
perhaps	RB
fifty

sat
there

made
a
serious
mistake

He
is

,

small
dogs

often

didnt

Because

This
scene
is
probably
the
pivotal	JJ
point
of
the
whole
book
...

1941
was
the
pivotal	JJR
year
of
the
war
.

The
polls
showed
that
the
candidate
was
thought
to
have
no
charisma
,
no
pizzazz	NN
,
no
passion
.

Students
paraded
round
the
campus
carrying
placards	NNS

He
held
a
placard	
saying
Disarm
Now
!

Nobody
would
tell
her
the
truth
:
they
were
all
too
anxious
to
placate	VB
and
to
soothe
...

...
the
desire
of
politicians
to
placate	VB
the
public
.

The
Presidents
speech
seemed
astonishingly
placatory	JJ
...

They
were
making
placatory	JJ
gestures
.

...
Steelhead
,
the
place	
where
I
was
staying
...

...
a
place	
called
Doulting
.

Of
course
it
was
no
place	
to
raise
a
child
with
damaged
lungs
...

The
saloon
,
I
decided
,
was
the
place	
for
me
.

Ive
just
been
bruised
in
two
places	NNS
getting
off
the

She
twisted
around
to
show
the
place	
on
her
back
...

Fires
were
still
burning
in
many
places	NNS
.

They
decided
to
relegate
the
massed
frontal
attack
to
second
place	NN
and
to
concentrate
on
a
small-scale
offensive
...

Adults
in
the
commune
took
second
place	
to
the
children
.

He
talked
about
how
well
were
placed	VBD|VBN
with
regard
to
America
and
Japan
...

As
for
finance
,
were
better
placed	VBD|VBN
than
people
think
...

Such
an
organization
could
help
and
encourage
those
similarly
placed	VBD|VBN
today
.

This
salary
should
be
placed	VBD|VBN
against
an
average
of
9,000
in
the
rest
of
the
profession

She
is
placed	VBD|VBN

She
took
first
place	VBD
in
the
Highlands

Thus
the
US
leapt
from
sixth
place	
to
second
in
the
league

fleets
.

Her
finger
was
pressed
to

He
pretended
to
have
lost
his
place	
in
his
notes
.

The
agreement
was
thus
not
placed	VBD|VBN
at
risk
...

Chamberlain
placed	VBD
the
Cabinet
in
a
difficult
situation

They

She
was

His
employer
placed	VBD|VBN
him
at

.

Two
of
the
children
still
havent
been
placed	VBD|VBN

The
New
Left
placed	VBD|VBN
much
emphasis
on
the
role
of
culture
...

The
government
had
placed	VBD|VBN
reliance
on
their

Vita
seemed
to
be
placing	VBG
most
of
the

on
her
mother
.

Dad
placed	VBD|VBN

We
placed	VBD|VBN

She
walked
to
the

the

situated

I
spent
a

directing

For

was
a

Londons

All

Id
better
go

Autumn

One

Someone

Suddenly
a
plate	NN
on

cracked

steam
roared
out

We
got
into

round
hole

I
read

The

heavy
scales

The
speaker
mounted
the

Chopins
performances

platform	
were
always
brilliant
.

It
provides
a
platform	
for
the
consumers
viewpoint

He
used
this
personal
battle
as
a
platform	
from
which
to
campaign
for
reform

He
campaigned

She
jumped
off

while
the

was
still
moving

Given
his
liking
for
platitudes	NNS

he
might
well
have
added

went
out

entered

Her
interest
in

She
accused

not
doing
enough

The

held

The

She
took

You

What

your
promotion	
prospects

Im
hoping

There
are
government
controls

the

The

Theyre
planning
a

The
promotion

the

most
important

A
strike
had
prompted	VBD|VBN
the
setting
up

the
committee
...

He
was
wondering
what
Lamin
had
overheard
to
prompt	VBN
that
question
...

My
choice
was
prompted	VBD|VBN
by
a
number
of
considerations
.

The
Times
article
prompted	VBD|VBN
him
to
call
a
meeting

the
staff

We
listened
so
attentively
that
the
Doctor
felt
prompted	VBD|VBN
to
expand
on
his
theme
...

It
was
Annes
nagging
which
prompted	VBD|VBN
me
into
this
visit
to
the
doctor
.

She
needed
to
be
prompted	VBD|VBN
three
times
.

I
had
to
be
given
a
prompt	
.

Yes
?
Morris
prompted	VBD|VBN
,
after
a
pause
.

The

was
prompt	JJ
in

response
to
these
accusations

Mary
was
prompt	JJ

might
have
had
.

The

When

you

I
arrived

A
Prices

policy

He

We
can
never

The

Hospital

I
now
pronounce	VBD
you
man

The

Are
the
people
ready

pronounce	VB
their
verdict?Guilty
.

She
was
asked

His

He
spoke

He

Youd

English
people
often
find
the
pronunciation

difficult

Both
pronunciations	NNS
are
acceptable

My
Italian

are
always
correcting

If

may
I
suggest

What

surveyed

His

lay
propped	VBD|VBN
against

He
used
two

The

Often

The

gave

All

It

His

Turn

Could
you

She
asked

.

I
cant

I
tried

They
reacted	VBD

predecessors

He
was
clearly
reacting	VBG
against
Victorian
traditions
.

We
were
alarmed
at
the
way
in
which
Katie
reacted	VBD|VBN

The
water
was
reacting	VBG
with

My
work
has
never
been
a

against
Abstract
Expressionism
.

The
decade
ended
in
a
huge
reaction	
against
the
pill
...

The
burden
the
Act
placed
on
ratepayers
led
to
a
reaction	
against
public
expenditure
.

A
chemical
reaction	
occurs
in

fuel
cell

...
the
reaction	
of

molten
rock
.

Im
afraid
I
usually
have
a
bad
reaction	NN
to

.

This
was
a
victory
for
reactionary	JJ
forces
...

...
the
public
image
of
the
House
of
Lords
as

The

these
sensitive

They
are
making
the
reactors	NNS
as
safe
as
they
possibly
can
.

We
have
to
know
about

She
loved

she
read	VB
,
The
day
I
wrote
a
name
upon

She
taught
all
her
children
to
read	VB

write
at
an
early
age
...

My
mother
taught
me
how
to
read	VBZ
when
I
was
four
.

I
think
it
could
be
read	VB
as
the
simple
story
of
the
narrator
...

This
drawing
could
be
read	VB
as
an
exemplar
of
classical
expression
...

Conflicting
parts
of
the
ambivalent
signal
are
both
read	VBD
as
genuine
and
acted
upon
accordingly
.

Do
you
read	VBZ
me
,
Mrs
Jordache?

I
read	VB

she
said
softly
.

This
is

We
read	VB

loud

.

Wed

The

Modern

The

gathering
one
thousand
new

The

designed
to
shock
the
reader	VBD

As
the
reader	
may
well
imagine
,
by
now
I
was
exhausted
.

The
programme
was
written
and
produced
by
John
Powell
,
and
the
reader	
was
Tom
Jaffrey
.

Weve
just
published
a
new
reader	
in
French

Then
thats
set
up

a
readership	
of
about
ten
million
people

They
offered
me
a

at
the
University

He
readily	RB
accepted
an
invitation

Adorno

He
couldnt
readily	RB

We
all
said
Amen

when
the
readings	NNS
were
done

The
first

pretty
badly

...
activities
such
as
plays
,

,

specialist
lectures

The
failure
was
caused
by
a
gauge
which
stuck
,
giving
a
wrong
reading	
.

The
second
reading	
of
the
new
bill
will
be
on
Dec
.
15
.

It
seemed
clear
enough
to
him
,
from
his
reading	
of
the

.

It
is

to
tolerate
in

We
believe
that
the
need

realignment

now
be
faced

They
are
doing
valuable
work
which
idealists
as
well
as
realists	NNS
would
want
to
see
done
.

They
were
much
more
realistic	JJ

made

An

it
fear

led

redouble	VBD

furious
strokes

The

She
realised

He
did
all
that

possibly
could

They
have
promised

The

have

reduced	VBD|VBN
from

They
used

Every
building
in
the

was
reduced	VBD|VBN
to

This
kind
of
analysis
reduces	VBZ
the
problem
to
its
simplest
form
.

Any

would
be
quickly
reduced	VBD|VBN

They
were
reduced	VBD|VBN

desperate
measures

We
were
reduced	VBD|VBN

Boil
all

They
have
made
substantial
reductions	VB

We
do
not
expect

I
objected
to
this

The

They

Beyond

up

Reels	NNS

She
gave
him
a
smack
in

sent
him
reeling	VBG
off

We
reeled	VBD|VBN
from
the
shock
of
discovering
that
our

father
was
a
liar
.

My
brain
reeled	VBD|VBN
with
all
my

His

was
dazed

reeling	VBG
with
all

he
had
seen

They

forced

Their

are
continually
being
refined	VBD|VBN

I
used
these
meetings
to
refine	VB
my
ideas

The
original

has
to
be
refined	VBD|VBN
.

They
had
a
gigantic
and
very
refined	JJ

The

levels
that

not
reflect	VB

true
value

This
impermanence
is
reflected	VBD|VBN
in
society
in
many
subtle
ways
.

There
are
whole
areas

human
life
that
you
cant
reflect	VB

Although
it

it

A
lot
of
these
materials
absorb
more
energy
than
they
reflect	VB

It
was
a
sunny
day

the
light
reflected	VBD|VBN
off

waiting
cars
.

...
an
oval
mirror
which
reflected	VBD|VBN

entire

I
saw

mistily
reflected	VBD|VBN
in

water

...
the
mirrors
where
you
see

I
have
of
course
had
a
chance
to
reflect	VB

think
about

I
reflected	VBD|VBN

suppose
I
cant

Obviously
your
behaviour
is
going
to
reflect	VB
on

whole
group

The
story
reflected	VBD|VBN
badly
on
Amity
and
worse
on
Brody
.

Their
behaviour
in
this
respect
was
a
reflection

very
different
personalities

it
an
accurate
reflection

Obviously
this
issue
is
a
very
sad
reflection	
on
the
state
of

Labour

I
thought
this
a
very
fair
reflection	
upon
the
way
in
which
she
lived
her
life
.

She
was
standing
there
looking

checked

They
try

widen

It
was
a
refreshing	JJ
change
for

found

.

His

had
to
visit
some
of
her
relatives	NNS
for
a
few
days
.

All
human
values

relative	JJ

They
teach
the

He
saw
that
nothing
was
wrong
,
and
relaxed	VBD|VBN

Some
people

Just

The

relaxed	VBD|VBN

She
watched
the
muscles

hardening

relaxing	VBG
.

He
relaxed	VBD|VBN
his
grip
on

.

At
the
beginning
of

the
rules
were
relaxed	VBD|VBN

He
had
no
intention

I
was
determined
not

Somehow
he
had
to
relax	VB
the

.

She
gave
the
impression

being
quite
relaxed	JJ

It

relaxing	JJ
place

Nearly

I
was

This

He
was

The

His

The

announced
a

We

He

I
ran

Much

This
kind

In

This

him

embarrassment

By
writing
down
all

you
relieve	VB
yourself

Hendricks
smiled
,
relishing	VBG
his

In

The

I
had
a
curious

Its
depressing
if

At

His
opening
remarks	NNS

serious

Technicians

She
found
it
almost
impossible

I
remember	VB
long
pieces

She
gave

Remember	VBD

That

Remember	VB
that

...

It
must
be
remembered	VBD|VBN
that
many
of
them
would
be
over
retirement
age
.

The
thing
for
which
he
will
be
remembered	VBD|VBN
by
history
is
his
honesty

He
will
be
remembered	VBD|VBN
as

On

You

She

He
wasnt
quite
sure
what
it
reminded	VBD|VBN
him
of
.

Seeing
her
again
was
a
painful
reminder	
of
how
different
things
had
been
five
years
ago
...

Just
a
reminder	
that
you

She
sent
him

Ive
had

fascinating
reminiscences	VB

their
marriage
...

I
spoke
with
the
hall
porter
and
exchanged
reminiscences	VBP
about
Robertson
.

He
lapsed
into
the
silence
of
reminiscence	
.

He
tells
many
stories
in
his
reminiscences	NNS
Time
Was

The
atmosphere
was
reminiscent	VBD
of
spy
movies
...

There
was
a
sweetish
smell
,
vaguely
reminiscent	JJ
of
coffee

We
listened

Captain
Imrie
speaking
,
quietly
reminiscent	JJ

In

reminiscent	VBD
moods
she
used

tell

childhood

Unfortunately
,
sociologists
have
been
remiss	VBG
in
countering

I
promised

The

took
the
opportunity

restate	VB
its

It
was
time
for
healthy
self-criticism

a
restatement

Try

I
owe
the
restoration

This

They
restricted	VBD|VBN
the

A
third
possible

The
State
should
restrict	VB

Id
like
to
start

Membership

Many

The

A
start
has
been
made
in
stimulating

The
use

could
result	VBD
in

Such

may
result	VB
in

You

If
the
whole

the

He

In

The

The

Mind

not

Some
critics
might
say
that

Im

bring

In

The

a

His

His

There

a
ripple

applause

The
ripples	NNS
created
by

entrance

It

a

The

With
the
rise	NN

has
come
a
new
willingness
to
take
risks
.

Ive
been
an
early
riser	
all
my
life
.

We
found
the
whole
ceremony
quite
risible	VBD

Boxer
Rising	
and
the
Revolution

A
big
peasant
rising

was
quelled
quickly

I
sank
to
my
knees
to
reduce
the
risk	
of
detection

...
a
life
made
thrilling
by
risk	
and
confrontation

...
the
risk	
that
technical
progress
wont
be
very
fast
.

To
commit
so
much
to
a
single
project
was
an
appalling
risk	VBD
...

Such
a
response
would
be
an
irrational
risk	
...

It
was
a
risk	
and
it
paid
off
.

Your
television
is
a
fire
risk	
if

If
something
isnt

about
that
tip
soon
,
its
going
to
be
a
health
risk	NN
.

Knowing
that
the
lines
were
tapped

I
had
not

She
guarded
the
reputation
of
her
friends
while
risking	VBG
her
own
.

The
whole
thing
has
become
too
risky	JJ
...

An
attorneys
life
was
drab
compared
with
the
riskier	JJR

more
exciting
career

The

asked

During

week

wedding
there
were
enough
festivities
to
satiate	VB
most
people
.

The
bed
was
spread
with
a
pink
satin	JJ
cover
.

It
is
a
satire	VB
on
the
administration

A
local
newspaper
had
printed
a
satirical	JJ
article
I
had
written
about
the
flats
.

He
considered
the
answers
to
these
questions
,
and
found
them
satisfactory	JJ
...

His
doctor
described
his
general
state
of
health
as
fairly
satisfactory	JJ
...

It
will
be
much
more
satisfactory	JJ
from
your
point
of
view
if
you
are
given
more
responsibility

He
was
well
satisfied	JJ
with
the

I
talked

had
bought
the

My
husband
and
I
are
very
satisfied	JJ
here
in
this
small
village
.

He
turned
to
me
and
nodded
,
satisfied	JJ
...

Now
we
can
be
satisfied	JJ
that
weve
missed
nothing
important
...

Im
satisfied	JJ
that
her
death
was
accidental

More
frequent
feeding

Your
curiosity
must
be
well
satisfied	VBD|VBN
if
you

no

The
firm
has
been
unable
to
satisfy	VB
demand
for
its
new
small
car

He
would
need

had
paid
tax
for
the
previous
three
years

This

I
glanced
around

satisfied	VBD|VBN
myself
that
the
last
diner
had
left
,
and
turned
off
the
lights

There
is
some
doubt
whether
they
can

our
general
entrance
requirements

a
Physics
degree

Are
all
these

Theres
nothing
more
satisfying	JJ
than
doing
the
work
you

They
found
themselves
in
the
most
satisfying	JJ
agreement
on
absolutely
everything
.

The
police
saturated	VBD|VBN

This

After

tomato

You
should
always

She
had
the

to

Youve
got
a

The
milk
was

She

Dont

All

he
sauntered	VBD|VBN
up

down
,
looking
at
the
shops

the
people
...

A
policeman
sauntered	VBD|VBN
over
from
across
the
road
to
find
out
what
the
crowd
was
doing
.

Lets
go
for
a
saunter	
in
the

.

We
lunched

meat

breakfast
.

His
voice
was
loud
and
savage	JJ
,
and
struck
them
into
silence
...

His
decision
to
resign
is
being
attacked
with
savage	JJ
ferocity
by
the
newspapers
.

An
opposition
spokesman
savaged	VBD|VBN

Its
always
a
good
idea
to
save	VBD
business
letters

I
decided
Id
save	VB
the
wine
for

...

Will
you
save	VB
him
a
place
at
your

He
made
a
brilliant
save	VBZ
.

No
visitors
are
allowed
save	IN
in
the
most
exceptional
cases
.

You
use
save	IN
for
to
introduce
the
only
things
,
people
,
or
ideas
that
prevent
your
main
statement
from
being
completely
true
.

The
building
societies
are
offering
high-interest
accounts
to
tempt
new
savers	NNS
.

The
whole
operation
was
computerized
,
thereby
effecting
a
considerable
saving	
in
time

money
...

The
new
management
had
achieved
even
bigger
savings	NNS

The

is
only
12a

Many
people
regarded
Churchill
as

I
savoured	VBD|VBN

mouthful
of

Marjoram
gives
a

He
leaned
back
into
his

relaxed
,
savouring	VBG
the
comfort
...

He
savoured	VBD|VBN

episodes

Bobby
played
sax	
in
a
band
.

I
must
say	VB
,
though
,
its
a
very
sexist
play
...

One
thing
you
have
to
say	VB
about
Americans
:
they
love
drama
.

Just
say	VB
you
found
buried
treasure

Would

Have
you

Lets
say	VB
you
won
1,000
.
What
would
you
do
with
it

He
said	VB
his
lines
perfectly
...

He
knelt
down
and
said	VBN
his
prayers
.

I
say	UH
,
sir
,
thats
a
remarkably
attractive
girl
.

Teachers
have
had
very
little
say	VBD
in
the
new
curriculum

People
want
a
much
greater
say	
in
how
the
country
should
be
governed

There
is
a
saying

...
the

of
Chairman

Daniel

No

A
great
scab	
had
formed
on
his

People

down

Dont

the
waters

When
it
was
cool
enough
not
to
scald	VB
my
lips

I
swallowed
the
coffee
and
asked

This

is
excellent

When

Her

The
scale	
of

The

She
scaled	VBD|VBN

We
had

It

It

The

In
their

the

found
an

The

The

The
first
years

It
wasnt

I
didnt

The

gave
me
a

I
wasnt

That
night
I
had
an
even
worse
scare	VBD

Since
none

the

died
down

There

Im
scared	JJ
that
these

How
would
you
like

It
would
be
a
tremendous
achievement
to
see	VBD
man
flying
under
his
own
power
...

In
recent
times
we
have
seen	VB
a
huge
split
develop
between
rich

poor
nations
.

Hed
seen	VB
a

She
seemed
to
think
that
shed

it
all
.

She
saw	VB
herself
seated
behind
the
cash
register
,
smiling.
...

It
is
perfectly
possible
to
see	VBD
a
situation
in
which
war
would
break
out
...

Can
you
see	VB
women
going

combat
carrying
forty-pound
guns

It
has
already
been
seen	VB
how
rocks

be
dated

We
saw	VB
in
the
last
chapter
some
of
the
risks
inherent
in
these
policies

As
we
shall
see	VB
later

this
is
an
attractive

He

Before

This
household
has
been
a
seed-bed
of
ill-will

strife

five
years

Education
should
be
a
seedbed	
in
which
to
plant
real
ideas
about

I
prepared

Thousands

Both

The

They
are
seeking	VBG
a
10
per
cent
a

reduction
in

work
force
.

I
keep
thinking
about
it
,
seeking	VBG
a
solution
to
my
problem
...

The
answers
they
seek	VBG
are
not

.

I
was
seeking	VBG
the
help
of
someone
who
spoke
French
...

His
views
on

war
were
sought	VB

Power

very
teaching
methods
our
parents
had
sought	VB
to
reject
.

Even
minor
problems
seem	VB
important

It
seemed	VBD|VBN
like
a
good
idea
.

He
seemed	VBG
nice
enough
...

You
seem	VB
to
be
very
interested
.

After
what
seemed	VBD|VBN
like
hours
he
came
out
with
a
wry
smile

There
dont
seem	VBD
to
be
many
people
on

It
seemed	VBD|VBN
as
though
I
had
known
them
for
a
very
long
time
.

I
used
to
lie
awake
at
night
watching
the
rain
seep	VB
through

Instead
of
draining
away

water
seeps	VBZ
down
into

.

Atrocity
stories
began
to
seep	VB
out
of
the
Congo
...

Reports
which
seeped	VBD|VBN
out
made
this
clear
.

He

Ignatius

By

David

seething	VBG
.

The

The

seethed	VBD|VBN

A

Different

are
painted

They
tried
to
segregate	VB
pedestrians

vehicles
...

Little
effort
was
made
to
segregate	VB
the
sexes
.

He
refused
to
play
before
segregated	JJ
audiences
...

None
of

opposing
teams
was
segregated	JJ

He

.

She
was
seized	VBD|VBN
with
the
desire
to
play
jazz

.

It
is
conceivable
that
he
had
a
seizure	
of
some
kind
and
then
drowned
...

During

There
was

she
could
select	VB

The

voted

They

They
are

The

were
asked
to
be
less
selective	JJ
in
their
reporting

The
selectors	NNS
chose

leave

I
consulted
the
other

In

Once

Without

Single

...
Jackie
Felt
,
our
trainer
and
self-appointed	VBD
spiritual
guide
...

The
revolutionarys
mission
was
a
self-appointed	JJ
role
.

Regular
encouragement
can
help
make
them
more
self-assertive	JJ
and
confident
.

His
monumental
self-assurance	
was
based
upon
his
complete
faith
in
his
own
ability
.

He
states
everything
in
a
self-assured	VBN
way
...

Personally
,
Im
more
self-assured	JJ
now
.

He
was
much
too
self-centred	JJ
to
notice
her
...

...
an
increasingly
self-centred	JJ
society
.

He
can
only
develop
self-confidence	
if
he
is
told
he
is
good
and
clever
...

We
began
to
lose
our
self-confidence	NN
.

Shes
a
strong
,
self-confident	JJ
woman
...

Because
they
are
self-confident	JJ
,
they
are
not
so
likely
to
regard
you
as
a
threat
.

I
stood
there
,
feeling
self-conscious	JJ
.
Was
my
hair
out
of
place?
...

At
first
I
was
self-conscious	JJ
about
being
a
movie
star
.

The
proletarian
movement
is
the
self-conscious	JJ
,
independent
movement
of
the
oppressed
classes
.

The
university
campus
is
like
a
self-contained	JJ
city
with
shops
and
all
amenities
...

The
intelligentsia
often
see
themselves
as
a
self-contained	JJ
group
outside
the
class
system
.

She
has
a
self-contained	JJ
three-roomed
flat
with
a
garden
.

He
lost
his
self-control	
and
cried
aloud
...

Clives
calmness
and
self-control	NN
was
very
impressive
.

She
appeared
calm
and
self-controlled	JJ
in
the
face
of
the
disaster
.

It
is
self-defeating	JJ
and
ultimately
suicidal
to
ignore
the
progress
of
events
...

...
a
self-defeating	JJ
policy
.

He
called
in
to
order
a
self-drive	JJ
hire
car
for
the
following
morning
.

For
a
self-educated	JJ
writer
I
think
his
work
shows
remarkable
talent
.

People
here
are
rather
self-effacing	JJ
...

He
has
shown
a
self-effacing	JJ
charm
.

...
his
job
as
a
self-employed	JJ
builder
and
decorator
.

He
wanted
to
regain
his
self-esteem	
...

Being
right
usually
adds
to
ones
self-esteem	NN
.

The
need
for
reform
was
self-evident	JJ
...

The
answers
to
moral
problems
are
not
self-evident	JJ
.

I
do
so
admire
your
superb
gift
of
self-expression	
...

...
opportunities
for
political
self-expression	
.

He
coughed
and
hummed
in
a
self-important	JJ
way
.

...
troubles
that
were
largely
self-imposed	JJ
...

...
self-imposed	JJ
restrictions

He
continued
to
be
self-indulgent	JJ
,
as
he
had
been
indulged
when
he
was
a
little
boy
.

It
is
not
enough
to
protect
animals
for
self-interested	JJ
reasons
alone
.

I
didnt
realize
you
were
so
selfish	VB

Her

Hes

She
was
at

fifteen

his

.

Harland
,
who
was
now
a
senior	
at
the

,
was
unfailingly
kind
to
me

She
gave
civics

where
the
seniors	NNS

The

listed
their
names
in
order

seniority	
.

This
gave
her
a
sharp
tingling
sensation	
that
ran
through
her
whole
body
...

It
produces
a
mild
burning
sensation	NN
in
the
mouth
.

It
was
a
strange
sensation	
to
return
to
the
school
again
after
so
long
...

She
had
the
sensation	VBZ
that
she
had
done
all
this
before
.

The

was
an
overnight

The

She

Surely
one
must
have
some
sense

right

wrong
...

They
seem
to
have
an
exaggerated
sense

Living
away
from
home
had
given
her
a
sense	
of
independence
...

I
was
overcome
by
a
sense	
of
failure
.

His
reply
left
me
with
the
sense	
that
we
would
never
reach
agreement
.

They
talked
rather
fast
,
making
it
very
difficult
for
her
to
grasp
the
sense	
of
what
they
were
saying
...

He
didnt
understand
every
word
,
but
he
got
the
sense	
of
it
.

He
may
not
be
lying
in
the
strict
sense	
of
the
word
,
but
he
is
certainly
hiding
something
from
us.
...

I
dont
like
the
Washington
climatein
all
senses	NNS
of

He
made

He
collapsed

senseless	JJ
...

A
heavy

We
have
to
be
careful
not
to
offend
our
readers
sensibilities	NNS
.

She
was
far
too
sensible	JJ
a
person
to
believe
these
ridiculous
lies
.

It
seemed
sensible	RB

comes
off
the
pages

Her
lightness

The

A

A

What

There
were
sniggers	VBD
from
the
children
when
the
lady
fell
over
.

He
took
out
a

,
after
snipping	VBG
off

lit

Brian

Linda
cut

snip	
of

The

a
snip	NN
at
twenty-five
pounds

The

an
easy
target

His
sniping	VBG
has
irritated

Just

A

Occasionally

come
out

absolutely
fascinating
snippets	NNS

On

I

They
started

,
and
after
that
,
to
cry

I

Like
both
her
parents
she
was
a
snob	
.

He
is
a
dreadful
intellectual
snob	NN
.

Because
she
was
too
shy

too
snobbish	JJ
to
mix
with
her
neighbours
,
she
had
few
friends

She

She

We

a
lovely

Its
good
to
be
alone
with
nobody
around
to
snoop	VB
or
make
a
fuss
...

He
might
have
been
killed
simply
for
snooping	VBG
around

We
caught
a
snooper	VBG
outside

in
the
hand
that
held
it

The
entire

Two

or
two
ago
.

This
snows
perfect
for
snowballs	NNS
...

...

snowball

Once
the

we
should
be
able
to
take
on
more
staff
.

She
was
always
snubbing	VBG
her
old
friends
by
pretending
not
to
see
them
.

Her
comments
were
clearly
intended
as
a
snub	
.

She
had
an
interesting
face
with
a
snub	JJ
nose
and
large
appealing
eyes
.

A
male
badger

Angela
snuffled	VBD|VBN
and

We
lit

fire
which
made
us
feel
very
snug	JJ
and
safe
.

He
stirred
and
turned
over
to
snuggle	VB
close
to
her
...

She
pulled
the
quilt
over

The

have
the
eyes
so	RB
located
as
to
give
panoramic
vision
...

Alternatively
you
can
so	RB
colour
it
as
to
break
up
the
contours
...

The
machine
is
so	RB
designed
that
you
only
need
one
hand

operate
it
.

This
mother

that
gradual
decaying
of
my
life
...

They
met
again
in
the
same
place
,
and
so	RB
it
had
continued
.

Just
as
one
gesture
can
have
many
different
meanings
,
so	IN
many
different
gestures

As

the
railways

with
coal

Im
so	RB
glad

had
never
felt
so	RB
alone
in
my
life

We
had
not
expected

overwhelming
a
response
...

Dont
go

fast

I
dont
think
that

I
found
his
style
of
lecturing
rather
soporific	VB
.

I
was
sopping	VB
wet
when
I
got
back
...

He
held
out
a
sopping	JJ
handful
of
clothes
.

I
was
determined
not
to
get
soppy	JJ
about
it
...

A
drawing
of
a
cat
will
always
sell
if
it
is
soppy	JJ
enough
.

His
mother
had
been
a
soprano	
with
the
Berlin
State
Opera
.

She
had
a
high
,
thin
soprano	
voice
.

Who
is
going
to
sing
soprano	NN
?

Their
decision
seems
to
have
been
dictated
by
sordid	JJ
material
interests
...

...
a
rather
sordid	JJ
affair
...

I
hope
you
dont
mind
my
mentioning
the
sordid	JJ
subject
of
finance
.

...
sordid	JJ
back
streets
in
the
poorest
part
of
town
...

During
her
research
she
witnessed
the
most
sordid	JJ
effects
of
heroin
.

Her
throat
was
so
sore	JJ
she
could
not
talk
...

Ive
got
sore	JJ
feet
after
all
that
walking
...

He
was
sore	JJ
all
over
.

She
had
a
big
open
sore	VBD
on
her
leg
...

After
infection
sets
in
,
sores	NNS
break
out
around
the
lips
.

Nobody
believed
him
of
course
,
and
this
made
him
sore	JJ
as
hell
...

I
tried
to
persuade
her
not
to
be
sore	JJ
about
it
.

He
made
a
face
of
sympathy
to
show
he
sorrowed	VBD|VBN
for
the
dead
son
.

After
all
these
sorrows	NNS
and
trials
,
she
had
become
a
very
embittered
person
...

...
enjoying
the
pleasures
and
suffering
the
sorrows	NNS
that
life
brings
.

It
was
a
sorrowful	JJ
day
in
that
town
when
the
orders
came
to
close
down
the
mine
...

She
was
giving
me
sorrowful	JJ
looks
.

Its
in
the
southeast
,
sorry	RB
,
southwest
corner
of
the
USA
...

The
other
three
suggestionssorryI
should
have
said
the
other
two
suggestions
,
were
very
helpful
.

There
is
an
unnecessary
amount
of
this
sort	
of
crime
...

I
know
youre
interested
in
this
sort	
of
thing
...

The
changes
are
of
a
rather
high
level
sort	NN
.

She
was
a
good
sort	
...

What
sort	
of
fellow
is
he
?
Did
you
like
him
?

Apart
from
his
occasional
sorties	NNS
to
Exeter
he
hardly
ever
left
the
farm
...

The
maid
kept
darting
out
on
little
sorties	NNS
.

The
counter-revolutionaries
made
guerrilla
sorties	NNS
into
the
border
regions
.

I
gave
the
bedroom
a
good
sort-out	NN
.

No
SOS	NN
messages
were
received
from
the
plane
.

There
was
no
sound
but
the
soughing	VBG
of
the
breeze
in
the
pine
trees
.

The
most
sought-after	JJ
item
was
an
early
painting
by
Picasso
...

She
became
quite
sought-after	JJ
as
an
after-dinner
speaker
.

They
said
a
prayer
for
the
souls	VBZ
of
the
men
who
had
been
drowned
in
the
storm
.

Only
someone
with
the
soul	
of
a
poet
can
really
understand
this
...

His
soul	
was
in
turmoil
.

...
the
soul	
of
the
American
people
.

She
was
a
kind
and
generous
soul	
...

Some
poor
soul	VBP
will
be
looking
for
these
keys
.

When
I
first
went
there
I
didnt
know
a
single
soul

I
swear
I
will
never
tell
a

You

Miss
Lenaut

Ah

The

The

The

The

worked
all
night

When

finished
Morris
would
turn
down

Theyve
got

farm
down

Devon.That
sounds	VBZ
nice.
...

It
all
sounded	VBD
so
crazy
that
I
laughed
out
loud
...

It
sounds	VBZ
to
me
as
though
hes
just
doing
it
to
be
awkward
.

I
dont
like
the
sound	
of

She
had
a
rather
off-putting
manner
by
the
sound	NN
of
it
.

We
considered
calling
it
an

that
sounded	VBD|VBN

I
remember
everybody
called

He
had

I
believe
that
its
sound	JJ
for
boys

basically
the

Industrial

what
was
going
on
.

The
captain
of
the
boat
was
a
tall
,
spare	JJ
man
.

...
the
spare	JJ
but
elegant
precision
of
his
performance
.

She
was
sparing	JJ
with
heat
and
light
.

The
fire
sent
smoke
and
sparks	NNS
over
the
top
of
the
fence
...

...
a
spray
of
orange
sparks	NNS
.

Watch
the
gap
for
a
blue
spark	VB

If
there
isnt
one
,
check
the
points
in
the
circuit
.

...
large
eyes
with
a
little
spark	
of
excitement
dancing
slowly
in
each
.

I
told
her
a
little
about
my
life
at
her
age
,
and
I
saw
a
spark	
of
interest
...

The
spark	
of
resistance
in
them
is
all
too
easily
crushed
.

Something
sparked	VBD|VBN
white
against
the
wall
.

There
was
a
risk
that
the
decision
would
spark	VB
off
a
conflict
...

The
letter
sparked	VBD|VBN
off
a
friendship
between
the
two
men
...

What
first
sparked	VBD|VBN
my
interest
was
a
comment
of
Simons
.

They
looked
down
to
the
sea
,
sparkling	VBG
in
the
sun
...

The
lawn
outside
was
sparkling	VBG
with
frost
.

It
cleans
windows
,
mirrors
,
and
adds
sparkle	
to
silver
.

Hes
quite
different
at
partieswitty
,
outgoing
,
he
really
sparkles	VBZ
.

The
population
was
sparse	JJ
...

His
sparse	VBD
white
hair
was
ruffled
.

...
the
spartan	JJ
lives
of
the
islanders
...

We
prepared
for
a
more
spartan	VBD
existence
.

The
soreness
is
due
to
muscular
spasm	
...

Spasms	NNS
shook
her
lungs
and
chest
.

His
whole
body
was
one
spasm	
of
pain
...

...
a
spasm	
of
anger
.

As
she
talked
,
she
kept
making
spasmodic	JJ
dashes
to
the
window
.

The
child
may
be
born
deformed
,
spastic	JJ
,
or
crippled

some
way

She
works

spastics	NNS
...

...
the
Spastics	NNS
Society
.

The
incident
caused
another
spate	
of
protests
...

We
turned
on
our
television
to
hear
about
the
days
spate	
of
bans
and
detentions
...

We
had
a
spate	NN
of
bad
luck
.

...
the
childs
spatial	JJ
ability
...

None
of
us
had
the
right
kind
of
spatial	JJ
awareness

Many
people
are
against
spaying	
and
neutering
.

It
was
the
first
time
the
babys
name
had
ever
been
spoken	VB
.

The
men
at
the
airport
spoke	VB
fluent
English
...

He
does
not
speak	VB
English
very
well
...

How
many
languages
can
you
speak	VB
?

Mary
hasnt
done
her
homework
again.I
know
.
But
Ive
spoken	VB
to
her
about
it
and
I
think
she
will
do
it
in
future
.

Shes
speaking	VBG
to
her
neighbour
again
at
last
...

I
havent
been
on
speaking	VBG
terms
with
my
sister
for
three
years
...

They
were
rarely
on
speaking	VBG
terms
.

He
spoke	VB
well
of
me
to
his
parents
...

The
students
spoke	VB
highly
of
their
history
lecturer
...

Bill
,
it
was
said
,
never
spoke	VB
ill
of
other
people
.

I
think
I
can
speak	VB
for
everyone
here
when
I
say
that
we
deplore
this
violence
...

He
spoke	VB
for
a
whole
generation
in
his
poetry
...

Im
only
speaking	VBG
for
myself
,
not
for
my
colleagues
.

In
the
last
act
I
had
only
four
lines
to
speak	VB
...

People
seemed
to
want
to
hear
modern
verse
spoken	VB
on
the
stage
...

My
first
speaking	VBG
part
was
in
Henry
V
.

It
was
announced
that
the
Prime
Minister
would
speak	VB
to
the
nation
on
television
...

Speaking	VBG
in
the
debate
,
he
set
out
his
views
on
abortion
...

He
declined
to
speak	VB
at
the
Labour
Party
rally
.

Looks
sometimes
speak	VB
louder
than
words
...

The
music
spoke	VB
more
deeply
to
me
than
ever
before
...

...
the
past
of
which
these
ancient
stones
speak	VB
.

His
friends
and
colleagues
will
be
very
upset
.
Not
to
speak	IN
of
his
parents
.

When
a
speaker	NN
emphasises
something
,
he
often
speaks
more
loudly
...

Sometimes
the
listener
takes
over
the
talk
and
becomes
the
speaker	
.

The
chairman
got
up
to
introduce
the
speaker	
...

Only
a
few
of
us
can
ever
become
really
good
speakers	NNS
...

Forward
with
the
revolution
!
cried
the
speaker	
.

Some
sounds
are
very
difficult
for
French
speakers	VBD
of
English
.

The
left-hand
speaker	
doesnt
seem
to
be
working
.

He
snatched
up
his
spear	
...

They
sprang
about
brandishing
their
spears	NNS
.

The
warriors

Mondays

committed
to
his
specialism	
.

She
is
a
specialist	
in
Eastern
European
affairs
...

Its
a
good
thing
for
a
specialist	NN
to
have
to
explain
his
or
her
subject
.

I
went
to
a

found
I
had
too
little
sugar

an

...

I
have
acquired
a
great

knowledge

Work

Was

The

I
am
spurred	VBD|VBN

by
it

...
a
period
of
extremely
rapid
growth
,
spurred	VBD|VBN
by
the
advent
of
the
microprocessor
.

Unfortunately
there
is
no
spur	
to
efficiency
or
improvement
of
technology
...

The
shortage
of
labour
acts
as
a
powerful
spur	
to
more
economical
methods
of
production
.

He
clapped
his
spurs	NNS
to
the
horses
flanks
.

...
the
spurious	JJ
attractions
of
modernity
...

His
display
of
emotion
on
that
occasion
had
been
spurious	JJ
.

The
whole
argument
was
spurious	JJ
...

It
would
be
spurious	JJ
to
claim
that
redundancies
alone
will
solve
our
problems
.

...
fears
that
they
will
spurn	VB

I
cant
help
feeling
spurned	VB
...

...
his
spurned	VBD|VBN
gift
.

...
a
blow
that
sent
blood
spurting	VBG
from
his
mouth
...

The
water
spurted	VBD|VBN
out
...

My
arm
began
to
spurt	VBD
blood
.

...
a
small
,
clear
spurt	
of
flame
...

Water
came
out
of
the
tap
in
spurts	NNS
.

The
deer
spurted	VBD|VBN
with
her
last
strength
...

With
Claude
driving
they
spurted	VBD|VBN
through
back
streets
.

I
put
on
a
spurt	
and
caught
them
up
...

He
drove
fast
,
passing
cars
in
racing-driver
spurts	NNS
.

Then
the
engine
began
coughing
and
popping
and
sputtering	VBG
...

The
fire
sputtered	VBD|VBN
quietly
.

The
engine
gave
a
sputter	
and
died
.

A
member
of
his
staff
was
discovered
to
be
a
foreign
spy	VBD
...

A
police
spy	
infiltrated
his
rooms
and
sent
back
a
detailed
report

...
a
spy	
satellite
.

Three

its
embassy
officials

been
expelled

They

unfaithful
lovers

Suddenly
Quint
spied	VBD|VBN

triangular
fin
of
a
shark
coming
towards
them
.

Theyre
always
squabbling	VBG
over
little
details

I
had

Anti-riot

The
England
World

The

I
was
flying

ran
into

Francisco
Bay

He
squalled	VBD|VBN

There
was

If

Ive

I
folded
the
newspaper
neatly
into
a
square	NN
and
put

The

The

35

The

For

He
put
the
chart
on
the
coffee
table
and
set
it
square	RB
with
the
edges
.

He
squared	VBD|VBN
the
papers
before
him
and
studied
them

He
scored
seventeen
runs
to
win

Fifth

How

How

Dont

This

.

I
sat

squashed	VBD|VBN

We

My
hand
got

my

were
squashed	VBD|VBN
.

The
children
sat
in
the
back
so
there
wasnt
a
squash	
.

They
stayed
in
power
by
squashing	VBG
any
attempts
to
organize
an
opposition
party
...

Her
speech
squashed	VBD|VBN
all
the
rumours

early
election
.

We
gave
all
the
children
a

He

Scrawny

I
listened

His

He

We
all

it
was
a
bit

.

By
this
time
thousands

were
being
squeezed	VBD|VBN

Do

Like

it

a
question

public
statement	
about
the

The
very
statement	
of
these

demonstrated
the
weakness

This
isnt
a

a

Any
one
of
these
arguments
suffices	VBZ
to
make
my
case
.

In
1957
we
had
some
600
jet
fighters

a
sufficiency	
of
airfields

this

Did

Come

She
was
not

his
sugar-coated	JJ
promises

The
proposition
was
couched

a

phrase

didnt
manage

conceal
his

Can

Im
not
suggesting	VBG
that
the

was
your
fault

It
would
be
foolish
to
suggest	VB
that
everyone
in
Britain
is
rich
...

No
one
would
dream
of
suggesting	VBG
retirement
to
him
.

His
expression
suggested	VBD|VBN
some
pleasure
at
the
fact
that
I
had
come
...

It
is
ridiculous
to
increase
public
spending
at
a
time
when
all
the
evidence
suggests	VBZ
it
should
be
cut
.

We
used
swaying
green
curtains
to
suggest	VB
the
wood

He
was
a
strange
man

shy
,
eager
to
please
,
and
very
suggestible	JJ
.

I
made
a
few
suggestions	NNS
about
how
we
could
spend
the
afternoon
...

The
other
governments
greeted
the
suggestion	
with
caution
.

His
golf
club
recruits
mostly
on

.

He
replied
to
her
question
with
the
merest
suggestion	
of
a
smile
...

Her
hands
had
about
them
no

.

The
girls
stood
around
,
exchanging
gossip
and
calling
out
suggestive	JJ
remarks

If
she
said
something
that
I
considered
suggestive	JJ
,
I
would
make
a
sharp
retort
.

His
behaviour
was

tanned
by
the
sun

on
a
sandy
beach
under

hot
sun

You
need
plenty
of
sun	
and
fresh
air
.

We
all
sat
in
the
sun	
.

He
spent
Saturday
sunning	VBG
himself
on
the
beach
.

I
spent
my
afternoons
sunbathing	VBG
instead

doing
my
work
.

I
had
a
day
off
to
do
some
sunbathing	
.

The

full

She

The

Sunday

seventeenth

I
never

The
sundeck	
was
crowded
with
holidaymakers
.

All
and
sundry	JJ
means
everyone
;
an
informal
expression
.

We
passed
through
wheat
fields
and
golden
plots
of
sunflowers	NNS
.

To
stop
squinting
I
put
on
some

His

He

The

You
must
really
see
some
beautiful

here
.

Lally
was
sure
that
we
would
get
sunstroke	
while
we
were
fishing
.

They
sat
there
,
admiring
each
others
suntans	VBD
.

He
looked
fit
,
and
his
face
was
sun-tanned	JJ
.

That
corner

the

She
supped	VBD|VBN

Ill

Once
,
there
had
been
a
superabundance	
of
leaves
to
make
compost
.

This
species
is
famous
for
its
neat
foliage
and
superabundant	JJ
flowers

.

We
found
ourselves
aboard
a
superannuated	JJ
trawler
.

The
childrens
library
is
superb	JJ
...

Now
this
gives
you
,
I
think
,
a
superb	JJ
indication
of
his
capabilities
.

She
was
basking
in
superb	JJ
confidence
of
achievement
...

She
amazed
her
audiences
with
her
superb	JJ
authority
and
vocal
power
.

Teachers
sometimes
show
cruelty
by
being
supercilious	JJ
and
sarcastic
.

He
challenged
the
idea
of
womans
lack
of
a
super-ego	
,
her
dependence
upon
the
approval
of
others
.

Theyve
only
got
a
superficial	JJ
knowledge
of
linguistics
...

...
the
inadequacies
of
a
superficial	JJ
education
.

I
suddenly
realized
how
superficial	JJ
she
was
.

Most
of
the
wounds
were
only
superficial	JJ
.

Do
not
be
misled
by
the
superfluity	NN
of
allegedly
scientific
advice
.

Certain
parts
of
our
religion
have
become
superfluous	JJ
...

I
had
not
been
using

You
cant
control
wild
horses
with
just
a

unless
you

super-human
strength

There
is
something
superhuman	JJ
,
even
magical
and
alien
,
about
the
Pyramids
.

It
would
be
wrong
to
superimpose	VB
the
pattern
of
the
East-West
conflict
on
the
present
problems
.

The

The
school
prided
itself
upon
its
policy
of
providing
a
superior	JJ
education
...

The
computer
is
vastly
superior	VBD
to

He
was
in
a
state
of
depression
because
of
a
warning
from
a
superior	JJ
civil
servant
...

These
matters
are
better
left
to
someone
superior	JJ
to
you
.

Who
did
Boylan
think
he
was
to
be
so
superior?
...

Im
always
feeling
superior	JJ
about
all

He
turned
to
me
with
a
superior	
and
sarcastic
smile

You
wouldnt
understand
,
Clarissa
said
in
a
superior	
way
.

He
was
from
a
caste
so
superior	JJ
to
their
own
...

They
counted
themselves
the
most
superior	JJ
race
in
the
world
.

Myra
was
his
social
superior	
...

Dont
go
giving
yourself
airs
as
if
you
were
her
superior	
.

He
was
called
to
the
office
of
a
superior	
to
be
reprimanded
...

He
was
extra
polite
to
his
superiors	NNS
lest
something
adverse
might
be
written
about
him
.

These
factors
did
much

enemys

I
can
only
surmise	VB

The

Turing
surmised	VBD|VBN

was
the
key

All

I
think

this

Whats
your

They
assumed
I
was

It
was
a

The

The

The

Any

A

This
chapter

a
brief
survey

They
took
preliminary
surveys	NNS
and
then
started
drilling
...

...
aerial
surveys	NNS
.

After
I
saw
the
results
of
the
survey	
,
I
decided
not
to
buy
it
.

The
tool
was
a
survival	VBN
from
the
pre-machine
age
.

Four
of
his
brothers
had
died
as

the
fifth

Only
two
people
survived	VBD|VBN

fire

She
is
Britains
longest
surviving	VBG
transplant
patient
.

She
will
probably
survive	VB
me
by
many
years
.

There
are
three
main
types
of
reptile
that
survive	VB
today
from

I
doubt
whether
the
National
Health
Service
will
survive	VB
to
the
end
of
the
century
...

The
project
survived	VBG
three
changes
of
government
.

She
seems
to
have
survived	VBD|VBN
the
divorce
pretty
well

Youll
have
to
learn
to
make
difficult
decisions
if
you
are
to
survive	VB
in
business
.

I
talked
to
one
of
the
survivors	NNS
of
the
crash
...

There
are
no
reports
of
any
survivors	NNS

He
sounds
like
one
of

survivors	NNS

We
are
all
susceptible	JJ
to
advertising

These
organizations
are
susceptible	JJ
to
Government
pressure

Many
people
were
lightly
dressed
and
therefore
susceptible	VBN
to
burn
injuries
on
their
skin
...

Some
types
of
animal
hair
cause
allergy
in
a
susceptible	JJ
child
.

I
had
many
reasons
for
suspecting	VBG
this
approach
...

She
suspected	VBD|VBN
her
husbands
honesty
.

He
was
suspected	VBD|VBN
of
treason
...

My
friends
told
me
that
I
was
crazy
to
suspect	VB
her
.

Last
week
police
finally
had
a
suspect	
for
the
murder
.

The
man
who
always
keeps
his
office
door
shut

suspect	VBD

because
he
might
be
doing
no

The

in
the

There
were
demands
that
trial
by
jury
be
temporarily
suspended	VBN

Both
governments
are
refusing
to
suspend	VB
hostilities
...

Her
friends
had
to
suspend	VB
their
normal
judgements
and
allow
her
to
go
ahead
with
her
plans
.

The
people
involved
in
the
incident
have
been
suspended	VBD|VBN

Morgan

The
problem

They
had
nothing

sustain	VB
them
all

two
cups

coffee

The
foundations
were
not

We

Lets

little
business

I
talked	VBD|VBN
yesterday
about
the
problems
facing
young
people
in
todays
society

He
has
an
ability
to
talk	VBP
on
almost
any
topic
you
mention
.

Angus
Wilson
came
here
and
gave
a
talk	VBD
last
week
...

This
term
we
are
having
talks	NNS
on
careers
overseas
.

One
shouldnt
talk	VB
of
an
agreement
but
rather
of
a
possible
compromise
...

When
you
talk	VB
about
prose
and
poems
do
you
mean
literature
?

She
talked	VBD|VBN
herself
hoarse
...

She
talked	VBD|VBN
herself
into
a
state
of
righteous
indignation
.

At
least
the
superpowers
are
talking	VBD
to
one
another
.

Shy
students
are
sometimes
discouraged
by
the
more
talkative	JJ
members
of
the
class
...

John
wasnt
very
talkative	VBN
,
but
he
was
pleasant
to
be
with
.

He
is
very
much
at
ease
in
life
and
is
a
good
talker	
...

He
is
the
best
talker	
in
the
village
.

...
in
the
days
of
the
silent
film
and
the
early
talkies	NNS
.

My
teacher
gave
me
a
real
talking-to	NN
for
not
doing
my
homework
...

I
got
a
hell
of
a
talking-to	
when
I
got
home
.

He
was
a
tall	JJ
,
dark
and
undeniably
handsome
man
...

In
the
background
is
a
tall	JJ
cypress
tree
...

...
two
tall	JJ
glasses
of
pineapple
juice
.

The
door
was
opened
by
a
thin
,
tallish	JJ
woman
with
a
lined
face
.

Can
you
keep
a
tally	
of
your
own
marks
,
please?
...

The
tally	
had
now
reached
thirty-six
.

Weve
checked
their
stories
and
they
dont
quite
tally	VB
...

The
amount
she
said
she
had
received
failed
to
tally	VB
with
the
figure
shown
in
the
records
.

The
owls
formidable
talons	NNS
can
carry
birds
up
to
the
size
of
a
chicken
.

We
decided
to
let
it
go
because
it
would
never
have
got
tame	JJ
;

birds
never
do

...
a

monkey
.

...
the
urbane
societies
of
the
West
,
with
their
tame	JJ
populations
made
gentle
by
decades
of
prosperity
.

It
sounded
like
a
rather
tame	JJ
party
.

He
made
quite
a
name
for
himself
taming	VBG
hawks
.

Within
two
years
they
had
tamed	VBD|VBN
this
inhospitable
landscape
.

This
urge
to
take
revenge
is
something
that
we
have
to
tame	VB
.

Her
bare
legs
and
arms
had
lost
all
their
tan	VBZ
.

He
was
never
going
to
tan	VB
,
no
matter
how
many
months
he
spent
in
the
sun

...
the

of

expensive

The
cologne
gave
a
tang	
to
the
air
around
him
.

My
remark
was
considered
somewhat
tangential	JJ
.

His
brief
rule
as
Prime
Minister
brought
few
tangible	JJ
benefits
to
the
poor
...

Then
there
are
less
tangible	JJ
factors
like
job
satisfaction
.

On
their
left
was
an
impenetrable
tangle	
of
creepers
and
trees
...

There
were
tangles	NNS
of
barbed
wire
on
the
wall

My
tax
affairs
were
in

He
shouldnt
have
allowed
the
strings

the
parachute
to
tangle	VB

His
leg
may
have
got
tangled	VBD|VBN

face

The
wires

Can

Theyve
been
tantalizing	VBG
him

heard

Tony
still
had
a
fine
treble	JJ
voice
.

In
the
middle
of
the
lawn
was
a
great
cedar
tree	
...

The
trees	NNS

were
in
full
leaf

driving
through
the
treeless	JJ
mountains

...
a
pleasant
tree-lined	JJ
avenue

Monkeys
were
bounding
away
through

Clouds
of
birds
rose
from
the
tree-tops

...
planes
flying
at
tree-top
level
.

They
trekked	VBD|VBN
for
three
days
along
the
banks
of
the
Zambezi
...

I
used
to
see
the
workers
trekking	VBG
every
morning
to
the
steel
mills
.

We
set
off
on
another
four
hour
trek	
through
swamps
and
fields
.

She
was
aware
of
the
tremble	NN
of
his
hands
.

The
wind
made
the
branches
shake
and
tremble	VB
.

He
felt
under
him
the
tremble	
and
hum
of
the
bridge
.

His
voice
trembled	VBD|VBN
with
theatrically
controlled
anger
.

Excitement
and
apprehension
added
a
tremble	
to
his
voice
.

His
father
and
mother
trembled	VBD|VBN
with
apprehension
about
his
future
.

There
was
a
tremendous	JJ
feeling
of
urgency
and
excitement
...

The
play
became
a
tremendous	JJ
hit
.

tale

...
a
marvellous

Warburton
detected
more
than
a
tremor	VBZ
in
the
voice
of
his
friend
...

Words
cannot
describe
the
tremor	NN
of
pleasure
that
went
through
me
.

There
had
been
a
tremor	
so
slight
that
I
did
not
even
feel
it
...

There
have
been
no
earthquakes
or
tremors	NNS
anywhere
near
here
in
living
memory

Organizational
tremors	NNS
are
similarly
felt
in
all

The
education
system
has
been
a
focal
point
for
minor
tremors	NNS
of
protest
in
the
last
few
years
.

I
forgot
to
dig
a
trench	
around
the
tent
...

Theyre
slightly
larger
than
gas
pipes
,
but
the
size
of
trench	VBD
required
is
the
same
.

Twelve
of
them
had
come
out
of
the
trench	
,
their
arms
raised
high
above
their
heads

...
the
hideous
conditions
of
trench	
warfare
.

There
is
a
trend	
towards
equal
opportunities
for
men
and
women
...

The
trend	
has
been
to
stress
more
the
artistic
side
of
education
...

A
more
reliable
indication
of
the
trend

Dont

No

...
She
sued
them
for
trespass	
...

They
began
to
organise
a
mass
trespass	
.

Each
of
this
sonorous
triad	
of
pleas
was
meant
to
be
taken
as
of
equal
weight
.

The

a
seat
.
Now
,
what
seems
to
be
the
trouble	
?

Hes
the
sort
of
person
who
always
makes
trouble	
...

If
there
is
trouble	
in
the
Birmingham
factory
,
management
might
decide
to
move
production
elsewhere
.

The
police
had
orders
to
intervene
at
the
first
sign
of
trouble	NN
.

She
sat
there
quietly
,
making
no
fuss
,
a
trouble	
to
no
one
.

Whats
troubling	VBG
you?
...

He
was
deeply
troubled	VBD|VBN
by
the
thought
that
she
might
leave
him
.

Is
your
knee
still
troubling	VBG
you
?

He
dismissed
the
deeds
as
forgeries
without
even
troubling	VBG
to
examine
them
.

Im
sorry
to
trouble	VB
you
,
but
I
wondered
if
we
could
have
a
word
some
time
...

I
do
apologise
for
troubling	VBG
you
,
especially
on
a
Sunday
.

We
live
in

Government
of
the
troubled	JJ
areas
has
been
left
too
long
with
colonial
administrators
.

Each
submarine
reported
a
trouble-free	JJ
launch
.

His
stammer
was
troublesome	JJ
for
him
...

...
troublesome	JJ
tenants
.

...
the
most
troublesome	JJ
issue
facing
the
commission
...

We
cant
afford
in
these
troublesome	JJ
times
to
have
a
Prime
Minister
who
is
weak
.

They
led
the
workhorses
to
the
watering
trough	
.

As
the
wave
bore
down
on
us
,
the
trough	NN
to
starboard
deepened
.

The
trough

Theres

Browns

29-2
.

I
watched
a

travelling
actors
.

His
father
used
to
have
trout	
for
breakfast

I
caught
seven
trout	NN
in

minutes
.

He
was
fiddling

in

with

.

You

I
found
the
truant	
throwing
stones
in
the
river
...

Truant	
children
ran
wild
.

Before
the
announcement
of
the
truce	
,
the
commandos
made
another
raid
.

There
was
a
big
truck	
parked
on
the
side
of
the
road
...

A
grocers
van
came
up
behind
the
truck	
and
began
hooting
to
get
by
...

We
heard
the
occasional
rumble
of
a
passing
truck	
.

The
farmer
drove
them
out
to
the
orchard
in
a
rusty
old
truck	
...

He
was
carted
away
in
the
back
of
a
truck	
full
of
other
wounded
men
.

Sallay
offered
to
truck	VB
the
camels
as
far
as
Glen
Helen
...

The
goods
were
trucked	VBD|VBN
to
a
warehouse
.

I
am
sick
of
having
to
truckle	VB
to
the
professors
.

There
was
a
whole
truckload	
of
us
.

He
was
a
truculent	JJ
and
quarrelsome
man
.

There
was
a
stream
of
refugees
trudging	VBG
up
the
valley
towards
the
border
...

He
trudged	VBD|VBN
wearily
along
the
path
.

They
set
off
before
dawn
for
the
long
trudge	
home
.

The
story
about
the
murder
is
true	JJ
...

She
gave
the
true	JJ
account
of
what
had
happened
...

Unfortunately
it
was
true	JJ
about
the
illness
of
little
Sylvie
.

Two-thirds
of
the
energy
from
power
stations
is
wasted
;
the
same
is
true	JJ
of
nuclear
power
stations
...

Research
also
shows
that
what
is
true	JJ
for
ability
is
also
true	JJ
for
achievement
.

He
looked
through
the
telescopic
sight
until
he
was
convinced
his
aim
was
true	JJ
.

The
window
frame
isnt
quite
true	JJ
.

He
soon
became
a
reliable
true-blue	JJ
country
club
conservative
.

He
gave
her
a
box
of
truffles	NNS
for
Christmas
.

He
would
go
after
it
like
a
pig
after
truffles	NNS
.

It
is
a
trite
and
obvious
truism	
that
people
act
in
accordance
with
their
motives
.

He
knew
he
had
behaved
badly
and
he
seemed
truly	RB
sorry
...

She
didnt
let
anyone
know
what
she
truly	RB
felt
.

And
truly	RB
,
coming
home
was
about
the
nicest
part
of
the
evening
.

She
trumped	VBD|VBN
his
news
by
announcing
that
she
had
been
picked
for
the
Olympic
team
.

He
put
the
trumpet	
to
his
lips
...

Hes
a
trumpet	
player
...

I
dont
think
I
know
of
any
duets
for
piano
and
trumpet	
.

The
two
elephants
stretch
up
their
necks
and
trumpet	VB
a
celebratory
chorus
.

The
elephants
trumpet	
was
very
loud
and
rather
frightening
.

This
ideology
was
being
trumpeted	VBD|VBN
very
effectively
by
highly
committed
party
members
...

The
local
newspaper
had
trumpeted	VBD|VBN
for
the
useful
vote
.

The
truncated	VBD|VBN
corpse
was
stuffed
into
a
rubber
bag
.

Last
night
police
with
truncheons	NNS
fought
a
pitched
battle
with
about
40
pickets
.

We
watched
the
combine
harvesters
trundling	VBG
through
the
ripening
maize
...

The
lorry
turned
the
corner
and
trundled	VBD|VBN
up
the
hill
.

She
saw
him
every
Saturday
,
trundling	VBG
the
push
chair
along
in
the
nearby
park
.

I
trundled	VB
along
to
the
enquiry
office
...

The
other
two
trundled	VBD|VBN
off
into
the
woods
.

I
sat
down
on
a
fallen
tree
trunk	
and
thought
deeply
.

We
had
to
go
and
buy
a
new
pair
of
trunks	NNS
yesterday
.

The
bank
robbers
trussed	VBD|VBN
up
the
manager
and
his
staff
and
locked
them
in
the
vault
.

Everybody
liked
and
trusted	VBD|VBN
him
...

You
can
never
trust	VB
a
man
.

I
trust	VB
you
to
find
them
...

She
didnt
trust	VB
anyone
to
look
after
her
child
properly
.

Shes
not
a
person
I
can
trust	VB
with
this
sort
of
secret
...

Next
year
I
hope
the
company
will
trust	VB
me
with
a
bigger
budget
.

I
slowly
found
myself
able
again
to
hope
and
trust	VB
in
the
human
race
.

Im
not
sure
I
trust	VB
their
story
.

I
dont
trust	VB
fancy
gimmicks
in
cars
...

He
wanted
to
get
up
and
walk
out
to
the
kitchen
,
but
he
didnt
trust	VB
his
legs
.

Dont
be
afraid
to
trust	VB
your
own
common
sense
...

Trust	VB
your
own
instincts
...

She
seems
to
trust	VBN
his
advice
about
people
.

The
people
of
England
are
discovering
that
it
is
no
good
trusting	VBG
to
the
old
politicians
...

I
suppose
well
just
have
to
trust	VB
to
luck
.

They
will
give
you
a
good
pension
,
I
trust?
...

I
trust	VB

...
charitable

...

Local

activities

nature
.

He
was
an
experienced

trustworthy	JJ
travelling
companion
.

There
is
no
truth	
in
the
story
...

There
is
of
course
an
element
of
truth	
in
this
argument
...

I
could
not
deny
the
truth	
of
this
statement
.

Its
a
book
that
contains
important
truths	NNS
...

The
purpose
of
scientific
method
is
to
select
a
single
truth	
from
among
many
hypothetical
truths	NNS
...

...
a
universal
truth	
.

Being
truthful	JJ
is
a
profoundly
practical
thing
...

Many
patients
are
more
truthful	JJ
when
they
talk
to
the
computer
than
when
they
talk
to
the
doctor
.

It
was
decided
that
we
would
go
and
have
a
try	
ourselves
...

After
a
few
tries	NNS
they
gave
up
...

Its
certainly
worth
a
try	NN
.

We
must
try	VB
and
understand

Angelica
started
to
try	VB

her
up

The

Mr
Denby

room
were
three
television
sets
,
each
tuned	VBD|VBN
to
a
different
station
...

Stay
tuned	VBD|VBN
to
Radio
Desland
for
a
further
announcement
.

I
have
managed
to
tune	VBZ
my
style
to
the
style
of
the
journal
I
am
now
writing
for
...

The
charge
has
got
to
be
very
finely
tuned	VBD|VBN
indeed
to
the
amount
of
rent
a
student
can
afford
.

The
emphasis
is
now
on
well-constructed
,
tuneful	JJ
songs
.

Harvey
did
a
little
dance
and
sang
a
tuneless	JJ
,
improvised
song
.

Suddenly
the
train
roared
into
a
tunnel	
and
everything
was
black
...

They
hid
it
in
the
tunnel	
under
our
house
.

One
person
suggested
tunnelling	VBG
under
the
walls
...

...
an
underground
stream
which
has
tunnelled	VBD|VBN
a
course
through
a
flaw
in
the
rocks
.

...
in
the
turbulent	JJ
days
that
followed
...

...
a
period
of
fierce
and
turbulent	JJ
struggle
...

She
tried
to
calm
her
turbulent	VB
thoughts
.

...
digging
top
quality
meadow
turves	NNS
.

The
pool
was
full
to
the
brim
with
some
very
brown
,
turgid	JJ
water
.

used
of
the
meat
of
a
turkey	
which
is
cooked
and
eaten
.

People
often
drink
white
wine
with
turkey	
.

He
made
a
smart
military
turn	
,
clicking
his
heels
.

The
engine
started
second
turn	
.

They
turned	VBD|VBN
their
guns
on
the
crowd
...

She
turned	VBD|VBN
green
eyes
on
him
.

There
was
a
long
line
of
cars
waiting
to
make
the
turn	NN
into
the
campus
.

...
a
turn	
in
the
road
.

They
undress
together
.
They
turn	VB
down
the
duvet
...

Her
dress
was
all
crumpled
and
turned	VBD|VBN
up
at
the
back
.

I
wonder
if
we
can
turn	VB
our
attention
to
something
you
mentioned
earlier
...

His
thoughts
turned	VBD|VBN
to
Calcutta
...

Turning	VBG
to
your
new
job
,
you
start
in
August
,
is
that
right
?

Shed
turned	VBD|VBN
to
him
for
help
...

What
could
I
do
?
Where
could
I
turn	VB
?

He
served
as
a
civil
servant
for
a
while
before
turning	VBG
to
political
life
...

Most
farmers
had
turned	VBD|VBN
from
crops
to
cattle
...

The
magistrates
have
turned	VBD|VBN
to
other
measures
.

If
you
apply
more
heat
,
of
course
the
water
turns	VBZ
into
steam
...

Soon
her
glee
turned	VBD|VBN
to
fear
...

...
a
dramatist
turned	VBD|VBN
scriptwriter
.

Those
who
had
turned	VBD|VBN
fifteen
could
leave
if
they
wanted
to
...

What
time
is
it?Just
turned	VBD|VBN
three
.

I
think
we
missed
our
turn	
back
there
.

In
that
year
things
took
a
sharp
turn	
for
the
worse
...

...
every
twist
and
turn	
in
government
economic
policy
...

Employers
,
needless
to
say
,
are
not
too
happy
about
this
turn	VBZ
of
events
.

Mrs
Reilly
is
having
one
of
her
turns	NNS
.

Shes
taking
a
turn	
in
the
garden
.

I
was
eager
to
know
what
had
caused
the
turnabout	
.

How
long
was
the
turnaround	
on
that
last
job
?

Take
the
third
turning	
on
the
left
...

We
must
have
missed
the
turning	VBD
.

Despite
hopes
of
a
larger
turnout	NN
they
were
well
pleased
with
the
rally
...

It
was
a
good
turn-out
.

Claude
approved
of
Daniels
turnout	
,
with
the
exception
of
his
tie
.

The
group
has
an
extremely
high
turnover	
of
members
.

Annual

is
about
9,000
million
...

Weve
got

.

He
was
still
smarting
from
the
tussle	
over
the
bottle
...

The
conflict
became
a
tussle	
of
national
wills
.

I
tussled	VBD|VBN
with
him
for
a
few
minutes
and
managed
to
wrench
the
book
from
his
grasp
.

When
the
students
are
making
their
choices
,
their
tutor	
may
well
guide
them
.

The
great
majority
were
tutored	VBD|VBN
by
parents

priests
...

Next

They
spent
the

evening
tut-tutting	VBG
about
the
lack

discipline
in
young
people
.

Ive
just
been
watching

He

He
agreed

knocked

I
just
gave
the
dial
a
twiddle	NN
and
it
fell
off
!

The
youngest
monkey
loved
dangling
by
one
arm
from
a
branch
,
twiddling	VBG
round

He
was
busy

fire
from

She
heard

I
kept
dropping

he
still
didnt
twig	VB

Her

For

Huge

She

Three

Never

Her

this

Their

My

This
created
an

His
death
was
hardly
unexpected	JJ

I
was
pondering

this

mystery

An

electrical

Its
unfair	JJ
to
expect
such

A
few
bad

were
gaining
an
unfair	JJ
advantage
.

This
is
,
strictly
speaking
,
unfair	JJ
to
Bowles
.

The
whole
academic
system
is
unfair	JJ
...

We
have
to
compete
with
them
on
unfair	JJ

Ive
never

His

were
unfashionable	JJ

The

has
largely
been
caused
by
an

unfavourable	JJ
weather

He
had
formed
an

opinion
of

This
might
perhaps
create
an
unfavourable	JJ
impression
.

She
had
been
drawing
unfavourable	JJ
comparisons
between

here

Hes

Adams
is
clearly
unfit	JJ

They
introduced
western
styles

education
which
unfitted	VBD|VBN
people

She
felt

My
reaction
to
his
story
as
it
unfolded	VBD|VBN
was
one
of
amazement
...

The
great
invasion
plan
was
beginning
to
unfold	VB
.

She
had
soon
unfolded	VBD|VBN
all
her
plans
to
him
...

Taking
a
deep
breath
,
I
unfolded	VBD|VBN
my

.

She
thrust
a
small
piece
of
paper
at
me
.
I
unfolded	VBD|VBN
it
.

This
was
an
unforeseen	JJ
complication
.

It
was
an
unforgettable	JJ

the
unforgettable	JJ
sound
of

...
an
unforgivable	JJ
error
in
judgement

It
is
unforgivable	JJ
to
wound
an
animal
instead
of
killing
it
.

He
is
unforgiving	JJ
to
his
enemies
.

Some
of
the
boys
taunted
those
unfortunates	NNS
still
working
in

fields
.

It
is
rather
unfortunate	JJ
that
the
Prime
Minister
should
have
said
this
...

Its
sad
about
that
young
boy
.
It
was
an
unfortunate	JJ
business
...

...
one
of
those
unfortunate	JJ
lulls
in
the

.

He
couldnt
wait
to
tell
Judy
.
Unfortunately	RB
she

Unfortunately	RB

Will

.

Mr
King
called
the
allegations
untrue
and
unfounded	JJ
...

Our
worst
fears
have
proved
unfounded	JJ
.

He
looked
unfriendly	JJ
...

Why
have
you
now
come
to
see
me
,
when
you
were
so
unfriendly	JJ
to
me
before
.

...
twelve
years
of
unfruitful	JJ
experience
...

This
line
of
questioning
proved
unfruitful	JJ
.

He
has
a
sense
of
unfulfilled	JJ
destiny
...

...
a
country
with
unfulfilled	JJ
potential

You
wont
find
me
ungenerous	JJ

I
felt
as
we
talked
that
I
had
been
ungenerous	JJ

George

I
should
not
be

Well
make

Dont

I

It
was
ungrateful	JJ

me

I
couldnt
go

leaving
my
suitcase
unguarded	JJ
.

I
told
him
,
in
an
unguarded	JJ
moment
,
what
I
planned
to
do
.

His
comment
drew
unguarded	JJ
support
from
the
others
.

This
would
give
black
people
the
opportunity
to
live
unhampered	JJ
by
racism

The
new

He
trudged
unhappily	RB
along
the
crunchy
gravel
towards
the

The
first
week
of
school
had
passed
unhappily	RB
.

Unhappily	RB

George
Devine
had
died
by
the

Ralph
got

Unhappily	RB
,
due
to
the
present
local
difficulties
we
are
unable
to
supply
you
with
these
goods
...

But
it
is
also
unhappily	RB
clear
that
these
demands
are
unreasonable
.

Id
rarely
seen
a
man
look
so
unhappy	JJ
...

He
lapsed
into
an
unhappy	JJ
silence
...

I
had
an
unhappy	JJ
time
at
school
.

The
residents
of
the
area
are
unhappy	JJ
about
the
crowds
and
the
noise
...

He
was
unhappy	JJ
with
the
returns
on
his
investments.
...

Id
be
rather
unhappy	JJ
to
see
that
happen
.

This
unhappy	JJ
state
of
affairs
would
not
exist
if
all
Ministers
acted
in
a

He
referred
in
his

to
an
unhappy	JJ
accident
that
had
taken
place
only
a
few
months
earlier

.

The
four
men
managed
to
escape
unharmed	JJ

The

was
diverted
to
allow

flight
of
wild
geese
to
go
on
their
way
,
unharmed	JJ
,
to
the
South
.

This
is
probably
the
most
unhealthy	JJ
place
in
the
world
...

Damp
clothes
are
unhealthy	JJ
.

The
wishes
of
the
minority
go
unheard	JJ

He
wrote
me
off

unheard	JJ

long
before
my
trial
.

His
cries
would
have
gone
unheeded	JJ

I
discovered
the
unholy	JJ

.

She
followed
him
into
the
hall
,
where
he
unhooked	VBD|VBN
his
hat

Her
voice
was
calm

unhurried	JJ

There
were

Someone
unrolled	VBD|VBN

They
set
off
across
the
prairie
with
long
streamers

unrolling	VBG
behind
them

She
remained
singularly
unruffled	JJ
when
confronted
with
my
discovery

the
unruffled	JJ
surface
of
the

He
picked
up
her
limp
hand
from
where
it
lay
on
the
unruffled	JJ
sheet
.

He
left

There
was

Their

make

The
middle
class
is
finding
life
increasingly
unsatisfactory	JJ

I
had
an
unsatisfactory	JJ
discussion
with
him
about
the
future
.

...
an
unsatisfied	VB
husband
...

He
asked
a
lot
of
questions

was
unsatisfied	JJ
with
the
answers

...
the
unsatisfying	JJ
pursuit
of
economic
growth

She
plunged

a

unsatisfying	VBD
affairs

Parts

unscrewed	VBD

The

Her
behaviour
was
beginning

It
unsettled	VBD|VBN
him
not
to
know
where

was

...
in
the
days
of
1968
,
when
everything
was
unsettled	JJ
...

...
the
unsettled	JJ
conditions
that
now
prevail

I
felt
pretty
unsettled	JJ
all
that
week
.

the

rootless

This
argument
remained
unsettled	JJ
until
January
1975
.

A
single
unshaded	JJ
light
hung
from
a
roof-beam
.

He
emerged
with
his
faith
in

system
unshaken	JJ

He
was
unshaken	JJ
in

prove

Franklin

unwashed

I
cant
bear

The

simply
read
:

an
unsmiling	JJ
blonde
secretary
...

Lebel
had
remained

throughout

This
is
the
major
unsolved	JJ
problem

The

probably
remain
forever
unsolved	JJ

It

Her

The

Gareth

a

All
I
really
remember
is
the
pain
,
the
unspeakable	JJ
pain
...

Their
treatment
of
women
is
unspeakable	JJ
.

They
called
for
the

all
foreign

I
was
full

By

they
all
increased

a

This

There

It

totally
unsubstantiated	JJ
accusation

One

Toms

If

Each

They

She
untangled	VBD|VBN
her

It
seems
important
to
try

His

In

1975
the

the

ordered
out

some

his

His
energy

The

The

Its

isnt
it?

This
is
not
the
familiar

depends
on
your
understanding
its
French
origins

Whos
used	VBD|VBN
all
my
shampoo?
...

In
1900
we
used	VBD|VBN
a
negligible
amount

I
had
used	VBD|VBN
my
allotted
tickets

Phil

Jenny

It
was
the
perfume
my
first

had
used	VBD

What
kind
of

do
you
use	VB
?

Both
Dick

Roger
use	VB
the

Its
a
phrase
I
once
heard
him
use	VB
in
a
sermon
...

I
hardly
ever
use	VB
any

Im
talking

The

she
used	VBD|VBN
was
Elizabeth
Gregory

Doesnt
he
use	VB
the

Aspiazu

The
United

might
use	VB
Britains
behaviour

an
excuse

For
the

he
felt

She
just
uses	VBD
people

He
might
later
have
a

for
it

The
fact

weight

Peculiar

He
wasnt
mad

weird	JJ

When
we
started
up

the
locals

He
moved
eagerly

his
visitor

Vernon
welcomed	VBD|VBN

You

Youre

I
warmly

I

we
must

the

Victorias
marriage
was
not

by
the
family
...

He
welcomed	VBD|VBN
the
long
days
of
hard
work
,
for
they
kept
him
from
thinking
too
much

Should
she
be
cool
and
withdrawn
,

warm

It
takes
speed

skill

this
heat

Put
this

There
are
faults

piece

His
task

The

She

On

She
explained
it
in
terms

any

reasonably
well-informed	VBD
layman
can

I
was
accompanied

had
never

West	RB

We
were
standing
on
the

Its

long

recognised

I
changed

What	VBZ
time
is
it?

What	WDT

In

Were
here
during
what	WP
amounts
to
our

This
leads
us
fairly

into
what	WP
careers

call

milk-round

I
share
your
concern
about
what	WP
is
rapidly
becoming
a
desperate
situation

I
went
to
the

read

I
could
find
about
Robert
Owens

He
volunteered
to
do
whatever	WP
he
could
.

She
had
to
rely

books
were
lying
around
...

Davis
had
given
up
whatever	VBD
hopes
he
may
have
had
.

You
dont
think
he
has
any
chance
of
winning

None
whatsoever.
...

I
had
no
social
life
whatsoever	VBP

I
dont
think
theres
any
evidence

.

She
wheedled	VBD|VBN
money
out

him

They
tried
to
wheedle	VB
her
into
leaving
the
house

The

Coughing
and
wheezing	VBG
,
he
climbed
up
the
last
few
steps
.

All
this
was
said
very
slowly
,
between
wheezes	NNS

Do
you
remember
that
time
when	WP
Adrian
phoned
up
from
Tunbridge
Wells?

There
were
times
when	WP
I
didnt
know
what
to
do

This
is
one
of
those
occasions
when	WP
I
really
do
regret
not
being
able
to
drive
.

I
will
not
give
anyone
my
whereabouts

money
was
incredibly
important

Whereas	IN
I
look
at
it
now
in
quite
a
different
way

shut
down

returned
to
Calcutta

His

be
tapped

immediately
appear
on

could

It
takes
me
an
hour
from
door
to
door
,
which	WP
is
not
bad
...

Its
all
a
question
of
priorities
.
Which	WP
brings
me
back
to
my
main
point
.

I
really
enjoy
these
dinners
,
unless
I
have
to
make
a
speech
,
in
which	WDT
case
Im
in
a
state

dreadful
anxiety

the
meal

Im
sure
he
would
do
full
justice
to
whichever	WDT
role
he
might
be
called
...

He
came
into
our
lives
,
or
we
came
into
his
,
whichever	WDT
way
you
care
to
look
at
it
.

Now
and
again
,
he
caught
a
whiff	
of
a
peculiar
smell
...

...
a
little
whiff	
of
perfume
.

...
a
whiff	
of
rebellion
...

Even
your
best
friends
will
betray
you
at
the
first
whiff	
of
political
danger
.

While	IN
he
was
turning
the
key
in
the
lock
,
someone
opened
a
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
corridor
...

The
car
got
three
severe
bumps
while	IN
parked
in
the
street
in
London
...

He
had
taken
out
his
handkerchief
several
times
while	IN
talking
to
her
and
blown
his
nose
.

One
group

Fred
gambled
his
money
away
while	IN
Julia
spent
hers
all
on
dresses
and
bric-a-brac
.

So
while	IN
I
have
sympathy
for
these
fellows
who
reacted
against
the
formality
of
their
predecessors
,
I
think
they
went
too
far
...

Your
missive
,
while	IN
complete
in
other
regards

skirted
the
subject
of

She
might
go

or
might
not

as
the
whim

They
are

a

superior

...

tendency
to
change
his
mind
at

.

I
was
listening
for
a
cry
or
a
whimper	
from
upstairs

Nearby
was
his
dog
,
whining	VBG
in
pain
from
its
broken
leg
...

I
pressed
the
button
and
the
clattering
and
whining	VBG
elevator
began
to
move
.

...
the
whine	
of
the
motor-cycle
sirens
.

My
father
was
a
brave
man
who
never
whined	VBD|VBN
or
complained
about
his
illness
.

He
was
annoying
Sarah
with
his
non-stop
whining	VBP
.

Again
he
was
lashed
with
whips	NNS
.

I
saw
him
whipping	VBG
his
team
of
mules
...

The
whipped	VBD|VBN
child
,
like
the
whipped	VBD|VBN
puppy
,
grows
into
an
obedient
,
inferior
creature
.

He
could
not
possibly
have
endured
a
whipping	VBD
without
a
moan
or
a
whimper
.

The
wind
whipped	VBD
my
face
.

All
that
could
be
seen
of
the
ship
were
her
flags
whipping	VBG
in
the
wind
.

I
whipped	VBD|VBN
out
a
hundred-dollar
bill
...

Glenn
whipped	VBD|VBN
off
the
mask
to
reveal
his
identity
...

He
took
hold
of
the
cheque
and
whipped	VBD|VBN
it
away
.

I
whipped	VBD|VBN
in
,
got
my
coat
,
whipped	VBD|VBN
out
,
and
got
back
in
the
car
...

...
the
sound
of
the
ball
whipping	VBG
past
my
nose
...

He
heard
the
wind
whipping	VBG
through
the
trees
.

His
men
were
not
a
particularly
brave
lot
,
but
they
could
be
whipped	VBD|VBN
into
a
frenzy
.

Theres
ten
tins
in
the
back
I
whipped	VBD|VBN
from
the
stores
at
Amirya
.

The
party
whips	NNS
had
to
give
group
lessons
on
how

We
flung
ourselves
into
the
mad
whirl	
of
pleasure

The
next
three
days
passed
in
a
whirl	
of
activity

heads
whirling	VBG
with

We
seemed

populations

buzzing
through

far-off
whirr	
of

I
was
whisked	VBD|VBN
into

with
fierce
abdominal
pains

She
was
whisked	VBD|VBN
off
by
her
parents
to
a
nice
school

The
curtain
whisked	VBD|VBN
back
.

With
a
whisk	
of
its
tail
,
it
was
gone
.

The
animals
whiskers	NNS
began
to
twitch

also
used
to
refer
to

glass
of
whisky	NN

a
large
whisky	
and

Castle
finished
his
whisky	
and
poured
himself
another
small
one
.

A
green
car
whispered	VBD|VBN
to
a
halt
in
front
of
her
.

Hooper
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper	
...

We
spoke
in
whispers	NNS
.

There
was
the
sound
of
steps
and
then
there
were
whispers	NNS
outside
his
door
...

There
were
whispers	NNS
about
the
Colonels

...
the
whisper	
of

through

branches

He
came
home
for
dinner
whistling	VBG
cheerfully

Mary
was
singing
and
I
was
whistling	VBG
little
bits
of
it

Itll
cost
five
million
.
Hagen
whistled	VBD|VBN
softly
to
show
that
he
was
impressed
.

The
wind
whistling	VBG
in
across
the
lake
blew
my
papers
away
...

...
the
bullets
that
whistled	VBD|VBN
past
his
head
.

The
train
whistled	VBD|VBN
as
it
approached
the
tunnel
.

Sally
let
out
a
low
whistle	
of
surprise
.

I
lay
listening
to
the
whistle	
of
the
wind
in
the
clock-tower
...

The
whistle	VBP
from
the
kettle
told
me
that
breakfast
was
nearly
ready
.

By
shrill
blasts
on
his
whistle	
the
policeman
stopped
all
the
traffic

The
guard
blew
his
whistle	NN

waved

light
was
growing

All

term
,
the
Kirks

She
had
gone
down
into
the
cellar
where
her
father
was
working	VBG

You

London
area
for
several
publishers

They
work	VB
the
streets
round
Paddington
.

People
who
have
never
worked	VBD|VBN
with
steel
have
trouble
understanding
this
...

He
always
works	VBZ
in
oil
paints
.

Hed
visited
a
commune
and
watched
the
peasants
and
intellectuals
working	VBG

land
together

The
farmers
are
now
able
to

much
larger

There
had
been
as
many

Norwegians

coal
mines
at
Tunheim
...

For
the
men
who
work	VB

wells
it
will
be
a
tough
life

From
inside
the
garage
there
came
the
sound
of
Coyne
working	VBG
a
lathe
...

I
ran
off
to
help
the
boy
who
worked	VBD|VBN

milking
machine
.

I
thought
your
bell
worked	VBD|VBN
...

The
traffic
lights
werent
working	VBG
properly
.

In
terms
of
theatrical
effect
,
it
seems
to
me
to
work	VB
amazingly
well
...

That
kind
of
democracy
will
never
work	VB
...

Frankness
works	VBZ
best
.

How
long
does
a
sleeping
pill
take
to

There
is
a
special
wire
cutter
which
works	VBZ
off

He
assiduously
applied
himself
to
learning
how
Parliament
worked	VBD|VBN
.

He
can
count
on
this
factor
working	VBG
in
his
favour
...

All
these
factors
work	VB
against
the
young
entrant
to
the
labour
market
...

The
restraining
influence
seemed
to
be
working	VBG
on
both
sides
.

His
brain
is
working	VBG
furiously
to
cope
with
the
complexities
.

They
work	VB
also
for
international
peace
...

We
worked	VBD|VBN
hard
to
persuade
them
that
we
were
genuinely
interested
.

I
had
the
opportunity
to
work	VBD
with
a
great
many
foster
children

I
worked	VBD|VBN

the
masses
on
land
reform
.

He
has
been
working	VBG
all
season
on
his
game
...

She
works	VBZ
hard
at
keeping
herself
fit
.

Someone
must
have
worked	VBD|VBN
at
it
with
a
crowbar
...

He
worked	VBD|VBN
on
the
lock
with
a
nail
file
and
finally
managed
to
get
the
door
to
open
.

Mr
Reagan
said
he
was
working	VBG
on
the
assumption
that
formal
negotiations
would
shortly
take
place
...

Evolution
theory
works	VBZ
on
the
idea
that
the
fittest
survive
and
produce
fit
offspring
.

As
soon
as
an
idea
tentatively
appears
,
it
is
quickly
worked	VBD|VBN
into
a
form
suitable
for
an
experimental
programme
.

The
ropes
had
worked	VBD|VBN
loose

The
thin
frock

She

rage

She
worked	VBD|VBN
it
so
that

never

The

worked	VBD|VBN

slowly
out

Gridgeley
left

and
worked	VBD|VBN
his
way
up
to
the
position
of
Head
of
Supplies
...

I
worked	VBD|VBN
my
way
through
his
writings
.

The
men
huddled
down
in
the
trench
worked	VBD|VBN
their
lips
to
ease
the

His

worked	VBD|VBN
expressively

This
doesnt
seem
to
me
to
be
a

We
will
examine
the

see
how
workable	JJ
it
is

The

affected
relations

We
went

Rescue

We
are
now
able
to
work
a
much
larger
area
with
a
smaller
workforce	NN
...

They
had
since
1969
agreed
to
reduce
the
workforce	
by
3500
.

I
milked
the
cows

led
the
workhorses	NNS
to
the
watering
trough
.

Jerrys
always
a
willing
workhorse	NN
.

They
tramped
from
workhouse	
to
workhouse	
...

The
ultimate
dread
was
the
workhouse	NN
.

They
are
asking
for
a
cut
in
the
working	JJ
week
to
an
average
of
thirty
hours
...

The
unions
will
be
demanding
a
reduction
in
working	JJ
hours
.

It
was
an
ordinary
working	JJ
day
for
them

People
are
now
losing
their

All
this
is

The

Minute
computers

are
invaluable
in

kind

In
the
first

I
picked
up
a
tolerable
working	JJ
knowledge

This

The

always
been

They
now

Often

entail
a

that
is
quite
impossible
to
combine

The

will
shut
up

improve

On

She
had
been
grievously
wounded	VBD|VBN
by
his
words
.

She
moved
through
the
soft
light
like
a
wraith	VB
.

They
wrangled	VBD|VBN
over
whose
turn
it
was
to
do
the
washing
up
.

This
debate
is
a
dry
,
procedural
wrangle	VBP
.

They
wrote
the
news
on
a
piece
of
paper
,
wrapped	VBD|VBN
it
round
a
stone
,
and
threw
it
into
the
next
door
garden
...

A
handkerchief
was
wrapped	VBD|VBN
around
his
left
hand
.

...
the
rustle
of
chocolate
wrappers	VBD
...

The
bottle
was
still
in
its
tissue-paper
wrapper	NN
.

He
picked
up
the
bottle
and
tore
off
its
paper
wrapping	NN
...

Take
the
polythene
wrappings	VBD
off
mattresses
and
pillows
you
are
going
to
store
away
.

Traces

these
chemicals

wreak	VB
havoc
on
sensitive
crops
...

...
the
terrible
damage
wreaked	VB
by
heavy
bombardment
.

He
wanted
to
wreak	VBD
revenge
on
his
colleagues
.

They
all
went
to
lay
wreaths	NNS
in
front
of
the
statue
...

...
a
funeral
wreath	
.

He
was
dressed
in
a
kilt
and
laurel
wreath	NN
.

The
dawn
sky
was
pale
,
the
sun
was
wreathed	VBD|VBN
in
mist
...

The
woman
was
sitting
wreathed	VBD|VBN
in
smoke
...

Smoke
wreathed	VBD|VBN
the
Colonels
head
like
a
halo
.

...
hats
wreathed	VBD|VBN
in
artificial
flowers
...

...
a
cross
wreathed	VBD|VBN
with
roses
.

I
wrecked	VBD|VBN
a
good
stereo
by
not
following
the
instructions
properly
...

...
acres
of
wasteland
,
covered
with
wrecked	VBD|VBN
cars
and
rubbish
.

Im
sorry
if
I
wrecked	VBD|VBN
your
weekend
...

He
wrecked	VBD|VBN
my
only
serious
relationship
.

Many
Spanish
vessels
were
wrecked	VBD|VBN
off
the
North
American
coast
.

All
around
were
the
wrecks	NNS
of
previous
crashes
.

The
seabed
where
the
wreck	NN
lies
is
level
and
rocky
.

Experts
arrived
to
examine
the
wreckage	NN
of
a
cargo
plane
...

They
hauled
Peter
clear
of
the
wreckage	
.

He
believed
that
it
was
now
time
to
consider
how
much
could
be
saved
from
the
wreckage	NN
of
Government
policies
...

...
contemplating
the
wreckage	
of
my
attempted
careers
in
law
and
politics
.

These
people
are
the
relationship
wreckers	NNS
and
the
misery
producers
.

So
I
set
about
trying
to
wrench	VB
my
button
off
...

He
tried
desperately
to
wrench	VB
away
the
club
...

I
wrenched	VBD|VBN
the
door
open
.

With
a
wrench	NN
,
Eileen
gained
possession
of
the
crayon
again
.

Travers
grabbed
his
arm
.
David
wrenched	VBD
free
and
went
on
furiously
:
You
dont
understand!
...

She
wrenched	VBD|VBN
herself
away
from
him
.

She
wrenched	VBD|VBN
her
arm
badly
.

I
tried
to
wrench	VB
my
gaze
away
from
the
appalling
sight
...

Finally
he
would
wrench	VB
his
mind
away
to
something
else
.

It
was
a
great
wrench	
to
leave
the
home
where
I
had
been
so
happy
.

He
wrested	VBD|VBN
the
knife
from
her
...

He
barely
tasted
the
small
piece
he
managed
to
wrest	VB
away
for
himself
.

...
the
near-impossibility
of
wresting	VBG
the
seat
from
the
United
Party
...

His
nephew
wrested	VBD
away
control
of
the
company
.

He
taught
his
little
brother
how
to
wrestle	VBD
...

John
wrestled	VBD|VBN
with
the
intruder
...

The
men
grabbed
him
again
,
wrestling	VBG
him
to
the
ground
.

For
decades
,
mathematicians
have
wrestled	VBD|VBN
with
this
problem
...

Viktor
Kowalski
was
wrestling	VBG
with
the
intricacies
of
international
telephone
enquiries
.

She
wondered
if
she
should
go
and
help
the
man
wrestle	VB
with
the
map
.

He
was
built
like
a
wrestler	
.

...
the
terrible
deed
of
the
wretch	
who
shot
down
the
President
.

And
the
poor
wretch	VBP
put
his
head
down
on
the
table
and
groaned
.

That
wretched	VBG
woman
,
what
she
went
through
God
knows
.

She
spent
most
of
the
day
in
her
room
lying
down
and
feeling
wretched	JJ
...

I
was
wretched	JJ
afterwards
,
thinking
what
Id
done
to
you
.

The
dressing
rooms
were
wretched	JJ
...

Her
own
poverty
meant
her
child
had
a
wretched	JJ
diet
.

He
insisted
on
telling
his
wretched	JJ
story
...

I
had
to
remount
the
wretched	JJ
animal
.

The
children
were
wriggling	VBG
in
anticipation
...

She
wriggled	VBD
her
toes
...

My
father
started
wriggling	VBG
about
in
his
chair
.

Are
we
nearly
there
?
she
said
with
an
impatient
wriggle	
.

We
had
to
wriggle	VB
under
the
fence
...

When
the
tadpoles
hatch
,
they
immediately
wriggle	VB
to
the
male
and
climb
on
his
back
.

He
looked
dazed
and
wrung	VB
his
hands
.

David
was
wringing	VB
my
heart
with
his
pitiful
little
efforts
to
help
.

His
small
eyes
were
surrounded
by
many
wrinkles	NNS
.

She
brushed
out
the
wrinkles	VB
in
her
dress
nervously
...

The
prime
ministers
toe
fidgeted
with
a
wrinkle	NN
in
the
carpet
.

Make
sure
you
clean
the
surface
well
otherwise
the
new
paint
might
wrinkle	VB
and
peel
...

Hes
always
telling
me
that
the
sun
will
wrinkle	VB
my
skin
.

He
wrinkled	VBD|VBN
his
nose
,
as
if
detecting
a
foul
smell
...

Jordache
wrinkled	VBD|VBN
his
forehead
,
as
though
he
was
trying
to
remember
something
.

...
a
very
old
woman
with
a
wrinkled	JJ
face
.

She
looked
over
her
shoulder
to
make
sure
her
dress
wasnt
wrinkled	VBP
at
the
back
...

The
flowers
have
wrinkled	JJ
brown
petals
.

She
grabbed
her
husband
firmly
by
the
wrist	
and
dragged
him
away
...

Her
body
seemed
shrunken
and
her
wrists	NNS
and
ankles
pitifully
thin
.

He
reacted
instead
by
issuing
a
writ	
for
libel
against
the
magazine
.

I
always
felt
that
I
wanted
to
write	VB
...

She
was
looking
for
a
masculine
name
to
write	VB
under
...

He
writes	VBZ
on
anthropology
.

In
American
English
,
you
can
also
write	VB
someone
.

If
there
is
anything
you
want
,
write	VB
me
.

All
the
research
on
learning
,
writes	VBZ
Dr
Lostock
of
Yale
,
seems
to
confirm
this
suggestion.
...

He
wrote	VB
that
he
was
never
depressed
by
anything
.

I
wrote	VB
a
cheque
for
100
...

Ill
write	VB
you
a
prescription
.

I
did
not
yet
take
the
idea
of
becoming
a
writer	
seriously
...

...
the
writer	
and
critic
,
Hilary
Spurling
.

What
sources
did
the
original
writers	NNS
have
on
which
to
base
their
account
?

His
body
writhed	VBD|VBN
,
his
face
contorted
,
his
eyes
rolled
wildly
...

He
writhed	VBD|VBN
in
agony
.

Writing	
has
made
me
a
millionaire
...

...
a
course
in
novel
writing	
.

...
the
small
,
neat
,
forward
sloping
writing	
that
she
knew
so
well
...

I
cant
read
your
writing	
.

The
idea
crops
up
with
increasing
frequency
in
the
writings	NNS
of
scientists
and
technologists
...

His
political
writings	NNS
remind
me
of
those
of
Sartre
.

I
think
the
timing
was
wrong	JJ
...

It
seemed
wrong	JJ
to
him
that
she
should
have
to
go
out
to
work
.

The
report
in
the
papers
was
wrong	JJ
...

He
had
been
given
some
wrong	JJ
information
...

...
a
clock
which
showed
the
wrong	JJ
time
.

If
they
are
right
,
then
I
am
wrong	JJ
...

We
had
to
admit
the
possibility
that
we
might
be
wrong	JJ
...

He
has
yet
to
be
proved
wrong	JJ
.

You
were
wrong	JJ
to
speak
to
the
newspapers
first
.

She
never
did
anything
wrong	JJ
...

Its
wrong	JJ
for
one
group
of
people
to
take
land
from
another
.

They
went
to
the
wrong	VBD
school
...

He
had
the
wrong	JJ
accent
.

Her
sense
of
being
the
wrong	RB
age
,
wrongly
dressed
,
wrongly
made-up
,
made
her
hostile
.

The
point
of
ironing
on
the
wrong	JJ
side
is
that
ironing
makes
the
materials
shiny
.

In
a
democracy
wrongs	NNS
should
be
righted
by
the
vote
and
not
by
violence
...

He
remembered
the
wrong	NN
done
to
him
many
years
previously
by
his
brother
.

He
was
obsessed
with
hitting
back
at
those
who
had
wronged	VBD|VBN
him
...

Many
people
experience
real
anxiety
if
they
feel
theyve
been
wronged	VBD|VBN
.

I
knew
I
had
wronged	VBD|VBN
her
terribly
when
I
accused
her
of
being
unfaithful
.

He
was
wrong-footed	VBD|VBN
by
a
beautiful
passing
backhand
.

I
tried
to
wrong-foot	VB
them
with
another
question
.

He
couldnt
sue
for
wrongful	JJ
arrest
...

...
the
wrongful	JJ
imprisonment
of
Napoleon
.

...
the
change
that
time
has
wrought	VB
...

That
moment
had
wrought	VB
a
profound
change
in
him
...

The
disease
wrought	VB
havoc
on
livestock
.

He
came
out
with
a
wry	JJ
smile
on
his
face
...

She
said
this
with
a
wry	JJ
glance
at
me
.

Over
the
beer
she
made
a
wry	JJ
face
and
said
Nasty
!

He
adopted
a
curiously
xenophobic	JJ
attitude
for
an
educated
man
.

I
enclose
a
Xerox	
of

That
morning
,

had

Your
X-rays	NNS
have
just
come
back
from
the
lab

The
chest
X-ray	
showed
moderate
enlargement
of
the
heart
.

After
an
injury
an
X-ray	VBD
is
often
desirable
...

I
have
to
go
and
have
an
X-ray	
tomorrow
.

He
had
been
X-rayed	VBD|VBN

weighed

Glenn
yanked	VBD|VBN

sore
tooth

He
was
yanking	VBG
the
cork

He
yanked	VBD|VBN
me
to
my
feet
in
a
moment
.

There
was
a
dog
running
along
the
streets

yapping	VBG
and
barking
.

I
hate
people
on

you

Jack
was
standing
under
a
tree
about
ten
yards	NNS

He
parked
about

from
the
gates

narrow
ledge

walked
out
into

through

gate

Mitsubishi
opened

The
road
was
lined
with
builders

She
was
a
yardstick	
against
which
I
could
measure
what
I
had
achieved
...

...
an
educational
situation
where
the
yardstick	
for
success
is
exam
achievement

We
swapped
yarns	NNS
for
a
while
,
always
the
same
stories

The
planes
yaw	VB

sat
up

stretched

yawned	VBD|VBN

I
yawned	VBD|VBN
all
through

tired

he
said

gave
a

yawn

She
stifled
a
yawn	
.

The
play
was
a
big
yawn	
from
start
to
finish
.

A
great
gap
yawned	VBD|VBN

yawning	VBG
